Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library , because someone finds it offensive ?
Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head .
Books , movies , music , magazines , or even computer excess .
So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot , because here we go .
So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library .
We I have came up with what I think about it .
In some way yes , but in other ways no .
For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time , just because they are old and overly out dated .
The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library .
Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive , doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library .
The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive , they book might be offending the other person .
So if you think about it , you will always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go .
I just put an example out there of what I have seen .
I was at a library one time and there way these to guys .
One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with .
Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library .
So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time .
During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at .
So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships .
Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years .
So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book , some music , or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are , because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason .
That reason is , because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book , magizne , movie , or just need to get on the computer .
Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf .
Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood .
The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged .
For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off .
That is bad that they would have that on there shelf , just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to .
Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs .
Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist ' as I call it .
A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents .
That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist ' means .
So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf .
Like I said earlier in this essay , you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about .
Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club .
So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up .
So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs , just refer back to this essay
