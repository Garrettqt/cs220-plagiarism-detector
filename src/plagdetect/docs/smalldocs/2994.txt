A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them .
Some people think that kind of thing is funny , but to others it @MONTH1 bother them .
Not only racial slurs can offend people , but profanity can make someone disappointed .
Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that .
And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too .
The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it .
They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie .
You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them .
Going to like school libraries , for books I think it really depends on the age group .
Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS4 .
They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines .
So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it .
And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school .
Even @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school .
One in example is 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6 ' .
Even though it is a really good book and a lot of @CAPS4 read it .
A lot of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 might get offended by all the racial slurs about @CAPS7 @CAPS8 .
They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them .
And the @CAPS4 or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading .
Or the libraries having books like that .
Me in example , next year I 'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it .
I 'm half @CAPS7 @CAPS12 and I do not like people saying things like that .
It is going to be a really akward moment for me .
And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book .
Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library .
The most challenged book in school libraries is @CAPS13 @CAPS14 .
I know this because my librarian told me this one day .
It is just a good book , but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards .
So they try to get them out of the library .
And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it .
I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it .
They should just get rid of it .
Same thing in a school , if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them , the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school .
They should just get rid of the book or magazine .
I believe that if it a book , song , movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it .
Parents might not want their kids seeing , hearing , or reading that sort of stuff .
And some people get offended by some books or movies .
Or they just do't feel comfortable .
I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it .
