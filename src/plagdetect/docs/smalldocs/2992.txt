When talking about censorship in libraries , I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves .
The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves , because their the ones thats going to the library anyway .
I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion , but I think certain materials should be removed .
For example , some music could be offensive ; therefore , I 'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries .
I 'm saying the offensive music should be removed
