In @DATE1's world , there are many things found offensive .
Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not .
Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not .
Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life .
This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this , which is wrong .
Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries .
They find these things to be offensive .
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended .
The world is a public place and everywhere we go , something might be found offensive .
The library is a place for study .
It is never intended to offend someone , or bring bad to the world .
It is simply a place to inform , and if someone is offended by what they see , they should stay away from the library .
I have been to the library many times , none of which have I ever seen anything offensive .
Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research .
There are certain sections in the library .
If a parent does not want their child seeing something , they should keep their child in the children's section .
I can assure you , there is nothing offensive in the children's section , or else the library would not have it in that section .
The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not .
If there was truly offensive materials in the library , those materials would be taken out .
Also , if a person complains , and the materials are removed , it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need .
One person could think the material is offensive , but someone else might want to learn more about it .
If one is offended by a certain material , all they simply must do , is not look at it .
The library can be compared to a big computer .
One can basically find anything there .
Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs .
It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there .
Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life .
If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone , they would have no materials left .
People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone .
There does not need to be any censorship in libraries .
It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books , music , movies , or whatever else one might go to the library to find .
