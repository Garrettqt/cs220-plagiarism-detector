Dear Newspaper , @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are , and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper ?
Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read ?
I believe that certain materials such as books , music , movies , ect .
that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves , let alone even be on the shelves .
Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book ?
That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays .
If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong , and have a clear judgement on it .
Or from another perspective what if that one book , about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty , fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken , old fashioned man .
Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery .
That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action .
Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face .
Then continues , after seeing what that alone has done to her , rapes and beats her .
Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living .
Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting .
@CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life .
Just think all that I have told you about , gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people .
these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves .
