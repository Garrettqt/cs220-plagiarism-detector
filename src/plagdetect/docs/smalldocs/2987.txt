All authors write for a purpose , whether it be to teach , entertain , or persuade an audience .
No author writes something and says , ' I hope no one picks this off of the shelf ! '
So , if every author wants to express something through their writing , then why should we not let them be heard .
We all have the freedom of speech , right ?
So , why not the freedom of writing ?
Libraries should not remove a book , music , movie , or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive .
Everyone will read a book that they don't like , its natural , but that doesn't mean that no one will like it .
Authors write for an audience , but maybe you are not in that audience ; so , it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive .
Not everyone believes in the same ideas .
You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way .
Like for instance , you 're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life .
She has gotten into some really horrible situations .
Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it .
But , did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations .
Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book ; suddenly she finds guidence in it .
She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before .
She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her .
So , would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence ?
Situations happen like this all of the time .
People find something special in what they read that other people might not find .
When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf , an opportunity is forever gone .
No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas .
We all have a right to learn , to explore new ideas , and to expand our minds .
No one should have the right to take that away
