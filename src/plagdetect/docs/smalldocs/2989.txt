Personally I don't think libraries , movie stores , etc.
, should be selling any of the items just mentioned .
If they are found offensive to the public .
I think it offends lots of people .
Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material .
I think in order to buy or rent certain books , music , movies , or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age .
The economy is bad enough the way it is .
There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment , and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies , or reading offensive books and magazines .
I think music is what influences a person the most .
If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not , that is going to just stay into a persons mind .
I know this from experience .
I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too .
For example , a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it .
Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself , 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble . '
That is just one example of how the humans mind can change .
In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read , watch , or listen to what they want .
I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though .
Also , I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library .
So that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending
