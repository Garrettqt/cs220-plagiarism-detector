The idea of the removal of 'offensive ' material from libraries is understandable .
Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view .
However , because we all have different opinions on what is offensive , I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library .
First , I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries , there would not be many books left on the shelf .
Offensive is a relative word .
What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another .
Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences .
Many books have things people disagree with , but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech .
Therefore , if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive , there would hardly be anything left , as Katherine Paterson said .
The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource .
If the sources were censored in such a way , it would be hard to get information .
Sometimes , it is beneficial , even , to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective .
However , some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people .
For example , some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view .
In this case , I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to .
Having books , music , movies , or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion , a ridiculous notion .
It hinders expression .
People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same .
If someone finds something particularly offensive , I believe they just should not view it
