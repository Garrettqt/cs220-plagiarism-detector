I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library .
All the bad books , music , magazines and movies no one really wants to read .
If a kid picks up the book and reads it , and there are bad content in the books , magazines , music and movies that would be bad to read .
If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad , then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies , music or magazines .
If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from .
There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books .
There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read .
There are things like books that talk about sex .
There can also be language that the kids should not read .
I know for sure , that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older .
There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to .
There is things like sex songs .
There are also things that don't say sex directly , but imply it .
I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that , I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs .
There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch , because of the content of the movie .
There are so many things in this world that contain bad things , which all have something to do with sex .
Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate .
Their is one more thing that I think is very important , which is magazines .
There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn .
I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn .
I think in general we should get rid of porn , and descusting pictures in magazines .
