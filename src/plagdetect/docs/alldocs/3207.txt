Should certain books , movies , magazines , music , etc.
, should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive .
Books , movies , magazines , music are made to relay a message , express a point of veiw , or to perhaps state an oppionion , of which everyone has a different point of veiw .
No , books , movies , magazines , music , etc.
, should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores .
All of the previously listed things are rated .
Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2 , books are rated child through adult , and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker , so just follow the ratings .
IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age .
People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it .
The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section .
Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d .
for entrance .
These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams , hope , desires , fantasies , and heart , they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit .
And most apparent if it offends you dont read it .
Simply follow the rating rules .
Take necesary precations .
If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy .
