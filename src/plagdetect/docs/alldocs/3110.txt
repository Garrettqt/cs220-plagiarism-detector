Do I think that certain materials such asd books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed froom libraries , no , because people might need to know a certain information , certain lessons are taught in different sources , all sources are liabilities .
Now , you just @MONTH1 need certain information , and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn .
For example if were to go in a library an need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teech me on that particular subject , or even sex I would need a magazine or move to watch to know new information .
There are different lessons taght in different aspects .
For example some people learn by example , movies , music , and magzines .
I it were to be me lokking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what i need .
Finally , those things are liabillities .
Don't get me wrong like we need them on a daily bases , but in a sense we sort of do .
We use search engines for everything , everyday .
so what do you think .
In conclusion i believe we need those sources because , someone @MONTH1 need certain information , there are diffferent lessons learned and taught in different things , a lastly ALL sources are liabillities
