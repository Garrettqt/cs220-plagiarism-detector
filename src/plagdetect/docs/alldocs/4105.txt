Censorship , only for the light hearted .
We have had this issue for as long as man can remeber .
Since we were only little kids to adults .
Everything was censored .
Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt .
I agree , censorship is needed for a certain period of time , but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle , that's when it goes out of hand .
I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous .
Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book .
However if its in a normal book , everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop .
I say its a library , let us read what we want to read .
Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered .
Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book .
As far a movies and music go , anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored , but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie .
So the point is , let there be censorship , but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words .
Censorship is for the lighthearted , and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like , just dont read it .
Thats all I have to say about censorship .
