Censorship , @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 ?
I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves .
Libraries are a place for learning and work .
If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward .
Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive , other @MONTH1 disagree .
Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library .
Your child finds a magazine .
It's ' @CAPS3 ' .
Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child .
If the library were to have not kept the magazine , it never would have happened .
Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously .
If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else .
The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle .
Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries .
How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books , or books with rude language , and scandalous themes .
If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult .
Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such .
