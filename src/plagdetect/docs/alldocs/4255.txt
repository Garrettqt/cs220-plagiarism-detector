Have you ever been reading something that made you mad ?
Well , to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody .
But thats just me , I 'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person .
No , I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive .
People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know .
If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with .
I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out .
Now , I 'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve , but I could image that there are people out that are like that .
If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it .
I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material .
To you it @MONTH1 be offensive , but to others its hilarious .
All I 'm trying to say just do ' n get all upset over something that you have read .
