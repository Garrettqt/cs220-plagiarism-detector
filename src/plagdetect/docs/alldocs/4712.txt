Although it is a new day and age where damand is high for elctronic books , hard back and paper back books are not obsolete quite yet .
Many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries , and starting the quest for the perfect book .
Also , with the economy at a downfall , it is the cheaper way to go .
But the big question is , can people find everything they desire at their local library ?
For some people that maynot be the case because of library censoring .
Yes it is true that many libraries now censore many things that they would think would be inapproite for childrens eyes .
I agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries .
Although some adults or teens desire more mature actricles , these things should not be avaible for children to view .
One of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents .
Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicet materials at that young of an age .
Also if libraries lose young families as customers , that would be almost half their clientel gone down the drain .
So next time when you want to buy something that maybe to mature for children , you might want to reconsider going to the library .
Instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there .
Keep children in a safe , innocent environment
