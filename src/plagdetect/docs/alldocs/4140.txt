I believe that certain materials such as books , music , movies , magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf .
I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf .
Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you 're cleaning up .
I 'm a @CAPS2 .
I 'm always trying to do the right thing .
And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things .
And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things .
And its something that would have to be done .
Removing anything from the shelf is not bad .
But it is not something that had to be done all the time .
It is something that some people might do .
It is not my thing .
I 'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others
