I believe that the certain materials such as books , music , movies , magazines , ect .
they are here for a reason .
People like them .
Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive .
Thats ok I 'm not try to say it isn't , but you don't have to look at that book .
There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up .
The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles .
People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers , but through these tools .
Tools is a better word for these things .
It makes them have a meaning .
Children now day love books , music , movies , magazines , ect .
As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it .
It builds our charater .
People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust .
They were ment to be picked up and look at .
I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this .
Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands , but that doesn't mean I have to agree .
Children , @CAPS1 , and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another .
Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well .
If people want this is going to be a big war .
Only because they are not the only people on the planet .
People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin .
Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then , something else .
Its just one right after another it won't stop .
This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other .
Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad .
In this case , my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be .
