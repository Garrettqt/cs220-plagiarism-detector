Do you think books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves ?
I beleave they shouldn't .
All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like .
Companies that manufactor books , movies , music , and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like .
and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness .
They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for .
All kinds of people buy things that they like .
How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people ?
Well thats how they feel when that happens to them .
What would be put in there places ?
Stores have to have something to fill the shevles .
Would they put more candy to make the world fat ?
If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it .
Others @MONTH1 like it like you like your favorite candy .
We have a great number of other things you can pick from
