The Author Katherine Paterson said , 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf .
But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
I do believe certain materials , such as music , books , and movies shouldn't be on a childrens shelf to read , but rather on an adult shelf .
I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that .
We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs .
If every book that was found offensive was taken of a shelf we would soon have no books left .
The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive .
Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs .
It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading , wacthing and listening to .
On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books .
Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person .
But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf .
that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work .
Learn to stand proud on what you believe .
Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books , music and magazines
