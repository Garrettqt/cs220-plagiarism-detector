Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2 Censorship in Libraries Should there be censorship in Libraries ?
If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no , but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library , yes .
I am going to tell you what I think about the books , movies and magazines .
First I 'm going to tell you about the books .
I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty .
Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say .
I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book , all that matter is that they are reading .
War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be .
Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs .
I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth , but keep it at a bare minimum .
Next I 'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library .
I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level .
Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies , no free days in class , its got to be @NUM3 .
In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3- @CAPS4 movies .
In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films , so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3- @CAPS4 .
Last I 'm going to tell you about magazines .
In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue .
Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that .
At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be , kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2 .
They just need to have learning and for fun magazines .
Should there be censorship in libraries ?
No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level .
@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should , should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies , and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1 .
