I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a room just for grown ups .
In the dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids can not go in there with out a parent .
So whenever you go in there your parent are with you .
But i dont think you can check them out .
But if i had a kid i would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so i think there should be seperate rooms .
So whenever they got older and maturd they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them .
But on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gon na see iot other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff why not let them learn on ther own from a book .
There are some people that woulf agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that .
So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want or maybe there should be rules that you cant go in there with out a parent .
I don't no what to do maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not .
But some people would be mad over that so if you chose one someone would not like it or aomething like that.My upion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on there own.Some people would think im a bad parent but would you want you child to find out somwhere else .
