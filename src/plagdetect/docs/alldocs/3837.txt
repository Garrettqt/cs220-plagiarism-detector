I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries .
All offensive material , as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it , should stay where they belong , which is in the library for all to read .
I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some .
My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer .
Most works , even the more crude pieces , have some sort of educational value .
Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life , people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way , not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them .
Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items , no matter the subject .
Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for , a resource for knowledge .
All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot , for learning purposes .
No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others .
