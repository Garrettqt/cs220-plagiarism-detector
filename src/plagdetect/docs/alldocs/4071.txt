Censorship in libraries ?
In my opinion I don't really care if books , movies , or magazines are censored .
I 'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books , magazines , and movies that are filled with perfanity .
In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it .
I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe .
Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers .
That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment !
Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone ... Well listen , there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad !
If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity , there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent !
I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear .
But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie .
One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes .
So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries .
If some people want to fill their mind with filth , let them .
But for you who do not , get other stuff .
Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch .
Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings
