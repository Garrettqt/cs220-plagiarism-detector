The @CAPS1 on Books In the world today , everything is showed every place you look .
Libraries are used by many people , people go there to research , study , and even just to find an interesting book to read .
One of the problems that some poeple are having is the exposing of personal things .
I believe that libraries should have a censorship .
Why should libraries have one ?
Here are my reasons why .
One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there .
Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like .
A library should be a place where children , young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf .
If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock , they should start an age limit on those books .
Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them .
Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books .
Also , another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading , watching and listening to .
Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing .
Cenorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues .
More public places should start a system of them .
The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet
