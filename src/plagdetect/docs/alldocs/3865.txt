Katherine Paterson , who is an author , thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library .
If you found a book in your public library offensive , would you want that book removed from your sight and public view ?
Personally , I wouldn't .
I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others .
In this essay , I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson .
In the sixth grade , I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system .
We had to find certain books in our school library , using this system , as an assignment .
One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .
I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like .
But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life .
After helping her find the @CAPS2 , she ask , ' @CAPS5 is this book so important to people ?
I don't understand it . '
I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me .
She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about .
It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all .
This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs .
If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her .
A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever .
Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries .
Unfortunatley , other people think this also .
One book can change a person's life , what if that book was not in the library to change another ?
