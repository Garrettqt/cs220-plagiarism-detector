i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries .
The reason why I say that is because of our first amenment which is freedom of speech we should be able to put anything in books , magazines , music , movies , and etc ..
The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings , depends on your point of views .
My first reason is the first amenment which is freedon of speech .
The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form .
Also , if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books it will go farther than that and it will come to a point where the first amenment will become cease .
In my culmination I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amenment .
I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views .
