When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything .
A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things .
Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday , it is in everything in books , movies , music , and magazines .
Should we keep things like this on shelfs ?
Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries .
On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures .
These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see .
Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries .
The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad .
If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this
