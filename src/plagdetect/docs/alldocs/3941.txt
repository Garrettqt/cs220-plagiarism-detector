Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive .
Like some books , music , movies , and magazines .
I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf .
It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to .
But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do , watch , or listen to something it make kids want it more .
Since they want it more they will find away to do , watch , or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be .
They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble .
With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today .
Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways .
Computers , televsion , and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time .
Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies , books , music , and magazines .
They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age .
That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe .
So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see .
Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it .
