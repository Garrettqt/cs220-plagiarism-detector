I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries , they listen to 'rebel ' music , or they just watch controvesial movies , so is censoring really effective ?
I do not think censoring is really necessary .
If you think a subject might be offensive for you , you should not read it .
instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers , I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read , watch , or listen .
Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school .
I would like to go to my school library and find books like , 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' , I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work , but it was once banned from some schools around the nation .
The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography , and it wasn't school appropiate .
My english teacher used this method , by telling us this , to encourage us to read it .
My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it , if you were to ask me ...
I did not find it .
Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 ' , this book was banned because @PERSON1 , a black character in the book , was called a @CAPS4 , and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book .
Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book , some people found this offensive and not appropiate .
Movies with strong language are rated for it's public so I don't think this should be a problem .
Music in the other hand , depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents .
I trully believe that we should not censor any material in libraries , but if it's necessary , they could stablish an age limit to check-out any controversial material .
As I said before , media is just another way to gain knowledge
