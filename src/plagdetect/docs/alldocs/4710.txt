I think that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive .
People enjoy books with offensive language or content , people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer .
I personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake .
'Your @CAPS1 * * * * * * cheating on me @CAPS2 * * * * ' , @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body .
Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1 ' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored .
If your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this .
Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library .
The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area .
libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you .
