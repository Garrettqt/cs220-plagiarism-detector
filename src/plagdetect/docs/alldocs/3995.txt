Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf ?
But if you had the right to remove the book would you ?
I believe if I found a book , magazine , any type of music , or a movie offensive I would not remove it , because everyone has a right to their own opinion , even if it is offensive .
Also , instead of removing the materials completely , why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive .
First , noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive .
Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music , books , movies , magazines or anything to intertain ourselves .
Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do , and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive , a big riot will start .
secondly , why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner ?
maybe instead of removing everything , why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger .
Same with music , movies , and magazines .
So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion , no matter if it is offensive or not .
I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it .
Because maybe that person who wrote the book , or movie was expressing how they feel , and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves .
So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do
