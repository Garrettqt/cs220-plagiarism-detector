Movies , books , music , magazines , and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about .
If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material .
Everyone is intitled to there own opions .
Theycan do and say what they want .
Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want .
As an author you provide a book to the public , If it gets that far .
When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like .
I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive .
Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material .
When a movie is made and it is ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie .
They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie .
If you find a movie , magazine , or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it .
Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not .
Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not .
You can not always make everyone happy .
If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf .
If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it .
If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that .
If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so , so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it ?
