READ WITH @CAPS1 I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials .
When a person enters a library , they immediately must infer that , because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated , that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe .
If a person believes a book is offensive , they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up .
Obviously , however , there are certain exceptions .
Childrens ' sections , of course , should be limited to those intended for younger readers .
Putting ' @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 ' into a childrens ' section hardly seems logical .
just as much as putting ' @CAPS4 @CAPS5 ' into the adults section .
In addition , author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library , the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well .
Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read .
the knowledge contained within them unknown .
There are , as with any ordinance , exceptions .
For example , if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences , censorship should hardly be considered a crime .
The exclusion of inappropriate items , such as permisquous reading material , keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand .
With all these things considered , banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action .
A library should be a place of enlightenment .
Opposing ideas should be presented .
Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe .
Because books are like atoms .
When two opposing types collide , a burst of energy is released .
