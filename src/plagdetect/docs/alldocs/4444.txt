well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing .
That would be like having six kids in one room and for no reason at all just give three kids a cookiee and not the other three that wouldnt be right now would it .
so if one person ones that book then another person wants that same book then they would have every right to grab that book and theres really nothing could say to them .
i know how it feels not haveing the same right as every one else like one time my teacher gave my friend a piece of gum for no reason at all and i was mad because i didnt get a pieace i thought if he got a pieace of gum for no reason then the rest of us should get one for no reason .
like said you give a right to one person then you should give that right to another person now i could under stand if three people were in volved in a fight and the third person was just standing there wactching the dont have the right to go to jail but the two that was phiscally fighting then they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight now the third guy that was wacthing he dont have the right to keep in any videos of the fight and he sould get a tickect
