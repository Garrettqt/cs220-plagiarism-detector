Censorship in Libraries I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things .
Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves .
If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things .
People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library
