Censorship in Libraries I know as well as everyone else does , that you can find almost anything , reading related , in the library .
There is all different kinds of stuff in there .
From children's books , to love stories and people's magazines , newspapers , movies , and music .
Everyone is welcome in the library , of course , but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want ?
I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library , for anyone , even though some of it's not very appropriate .
For people who sit at home and don't have a library , maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library .
Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place .
You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need , yeah , but , what if the internet doen't have what you 're looking for ?
I like books better then internet myself .
Anybody can put information on the computer , but atleast when it's in a book , it's true , because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public .
If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they 're not suppose to , then put it somewhere where they can't reach .
Put the adult books in the adult section , and don't let the little kids go in that area .
You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there .
All the libraries I 've ever been to , had their own sections , the adults would go to their section , and the kids would go to their's .
If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find , then keep them home and don't let them go to the library .
Make your own at home , then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there
