This is what's wrong with today's society .
We are too soft.We 're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that .
I 'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings .
And I say that to an extent .
If we 're talking about my friends , family , my girlfriend , that's totally different .
I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis .
But as far as people I don't know , I could care less what their beliefs , opinions , and outlooks on life are .
Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race .
Anybody ever think of that ?
If I had it my way , the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist .
@CAPS1 , radio , books , movies , magazines would all be uncensored .
Is life filtered and censored ?
Absolutely not !
So why should those things be ?
I 'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies .
They 've got ta learn sometime .
Life isn't lollipops and rainbows .
It's hard , unforgiving , and it kicks you in the teeth .
You 've just got to learn to adapt to it .
And censorship in libraries , on @CAPS1 etc , won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit .
I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much .
If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves , we would be fine .
Everytime I hear the word 'offensive ' it makes me sick to my stomach , because in my eyes , that word doesn't exist .
It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own
