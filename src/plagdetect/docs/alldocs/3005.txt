I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with .
If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be emtpy .
Then their would nothing left for people to read .
Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books take them off th shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material .
@PERSON1 @CAPS1 for example in the book ' @CAPS2 ' its offensive to gays and one gets killed .
