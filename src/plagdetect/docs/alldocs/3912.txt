No criteria such as books , @CAPS1's , magazines , etc .
should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive .
The @LOCATION1 is a free country , which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine , you don't have to read it .
When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy , simply because you don't have to go see that movie , or go read that book .
Different people find different things offensive , this can be because of race , gender , ethnicity , etc .
So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive .
Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game , when there are homeless people living on the street .
Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on .
Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good .
Another example is racial jokes , some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive .
This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes .
Just as Katherine Paterson said , no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive .
People do not find the same things offensive , so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue .
If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it .
Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone , somewhere finds offensive .
If we took all of these books off the shelves , there would be nothing left to read .
This is a free country , which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not .
So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library , just dont read them , because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do , and they might like to read that book .
