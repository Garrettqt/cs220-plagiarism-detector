Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials , such as books , movies , music , magazines , etc.
, from the shelves of a library , if the item is inapropiate .
I believe that libraries should not have censorship .
I personally , think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power .
If it is a library were there's always smaller children their , then I think they could have the power of censorship .
In conclusion , it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter .
Now , say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children , then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship .
First in for most , because its your choice of the item , if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it , watch it or listen to it .
Second of all , it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item , but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive .
Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period .
Last of all , members of the library would have the same right as the librarians .
So many of all the members have such different feelings on items , that so many different items would be taken off the shelf , that by the end there would be no books left .
In conclusion , personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries .
It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items , and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf .
There for , I believe cencorship is not need in libraries .
