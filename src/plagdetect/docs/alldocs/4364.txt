Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents .
like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot .
'
I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves ' .
thats bad !
And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them .
Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake ' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here .
It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie .
Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them .
i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset
