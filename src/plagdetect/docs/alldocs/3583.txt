I do believe that certain materials such as books , movies , magazines , etc should be removed from the shelfs if they are found offensive .
I think offensive books movies music and etc should be removed from shelfs becasue that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something innoproperiate its okay to watch .
I would not want my brother or sister to watch , or see anything thing that is not approperiate .
I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and step dad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1 , @CAPS1 or @NUM1 on my television , They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2 and it was innoproperiate in their opinion .
I disagreed with that , I thought I should have the right to have watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch .
Everything that was on @CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion .
When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1 every song that was being played was the edited version .
I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have @NUM2 , @NUM1 on my @CAPS2 .
Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children .
In my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad .
She knew what it was like when she was young .
She thought that maybe i would think what i see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing .
I was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad
