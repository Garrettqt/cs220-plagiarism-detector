Do you think that certain books , music , magazines are sometimes found very offensive ?
If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things .
I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world .
There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see .
When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop !
You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does .
We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them , but we can try to banned the bad books , movies , and music .
We need more good things to influence our children .
We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular .
If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them .
I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life .
These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children .
If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs .
I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away .
You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it .
