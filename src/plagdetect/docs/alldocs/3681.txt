Books are books we all read them and summary's over them .
To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly whats going on todays life .
So we shouldnt take books off the shelfs just like magizens .
They might have information to tell people around the world .
Thats why people make books and magizens so people like us can read them while were notbusy in life or just relaxin .
People read bad stuff all the time in books or magizens thats what life is about cause there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life .
I mean hey if you dont want your children readin them than have them not read at all .
Because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life .
There's stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them .
When there at that age in there life so there going to find out some how or another .
Cause there are schools that have alot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for there future's.Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history clases .
That talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad .
When kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble .
So if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it .
History classes are very helpfull because they teach you about all the different wars .
That has happend and who invaded other countrys or states .
They help out on findin places on a maps .
That shows all the wolds state and countrys and even where we live in our country .
So really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them .
Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and there time makin books .
Then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf .
What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing .
Whats the harm in it anyway
