'Book or no Book ? '
Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest .
Wheather that be cars , boats , toys , or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is .
I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things .
Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it .
This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast !
!
There are to many people making enimies all over the world .
I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too .
If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it .
There are multiple solutions to the problem .
The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies .
There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with .
Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out !
!
I also hope they people make the right vote .
Im not saying that my vote is the only way , its just my opinion .
Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy .
So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion !
