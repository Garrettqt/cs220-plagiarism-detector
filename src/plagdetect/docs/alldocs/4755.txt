Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive ?
If they are inapropriate , why do we keep putting those books , magazines , movies , and the big one , music out there in the world ?
Let me tell you why , because people in @LOCATION1 unfortunatly , have grown out of @CAPS1-duty time , @PERSON1 , @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , and many other nonoffensive shows .
But with the shows , books , and movies played today are very inapropriate to the younger viewers .
@DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons are over , at least the good cartoon like @CAPS4 and @PERSON3 , @ORGANIZATION1 , @CAPS5 , ect , these cartoons , that I used to watch , that taught me how to be @CAPS6 , @CAPS7 , and @CAPS8 have faded away .
With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children , all show @CAPS22 the same thing and that @CAPS22 @CAPS9 , @CAPS10 , @CAPS11 , and all the other @NUM1 deadly sins .
They show these without explaning anything that can help the child in life , and that @CAPS22 @CAPS12 .
We can @CAPS23 take books off the shelves , make directors ' quit directing , rappers ' quit rapping , or make the pornoghraphy stop but we can restrict it to a point .
It will always be out there weather it @CAPS22 by the blackmarket or the adult stores.Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows .
Restrictions on the television , make the offencive books , magazines in a library to a ( n ) restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 years old .
There @CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there .
It can be and @CAPS22 very offensive .
I was born and raised on the old fasion country music and unfortunatly country music has gone to the dogs .
Sorry to say but the change in music started at the begining of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13 , with the hippies .
While they where all hopped up on @CAPS14 , @CAPS15 , and @CAPS16 , they brought to life the new @CAPS17 and @CAPS18 .
So it has been here over @NUM3 years it @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going away .
All we can do @CAPS22 hope our children does @CAPS23 turn on the radio that @CAPS22 tuned into that crap and say ' @CAPS19 that sound like good music . '
With the pornoghraphic magazines , they have been around since @PERSON2 was in her prime .
It @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do .
All we can do @CAPS22 block it out of our lives .
We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will @CAPS23 help they will always be known to this world .
I think we should move these things to another part of the library , that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library .
Then we will move onto the music , and then the shows .
Remember it will always be out there , all we can do as @CAPS20 @CAPS22 try to keep it out of reach of our children .
We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes .
With the will power of @CAPS20 it CAN be done.FAILURE @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24 @CAPS25 !
