You are the mother or father of a young child , and you take them to the library .
While there , you see some advertising for a new book .
The sign is all bright and flashy , so you stop to read it .
It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here , for they are far to inappropriate and offensive .
What would you do ?
Personally , I believe that if you see something like that , that you believe is offensive , you should say something .
Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on .
Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework , is just plain wrong .
What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what ?
So many kids could check things like that out , and not even know what it actually is !
Could you imagine your child coming home from the library , and handing you a book , magazine , or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age ?
It would be disasterous !
I @MONTH1 not have children , but I do have younger cousins .
I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive , their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian .
Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who .
For example , my library has three different kinds of library cards .
One card is just to check out regular books .
Another is so you can check out movies , music , and books .
Then the third and final card is so you can check out books , music , and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library .
However , to even be eligible for the third card , you have to be eighteen or older .
I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive , they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library , or behind the librarians desk .
This way , noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to .
If someone did want to see or check out these materials , they should need proof that they are eighteen or older .
This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials .
Another thing , what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't ?
Well , I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive , before it is actually taken off the shelf .
If more than one person does say something , the librarian should place the book , magazine , movie , music , ect.
, in with the other offensive materials , where there is an age restriction .
This is how it is at my neighboorhood library , and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions .
If all libraries had more restrictions , it would be better off for everyone .
Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them .
Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials .
In conclusion , I hope you take all that I have said to heart .
I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries , and how they would make everything better off .
Thank you for taking the time to read this
