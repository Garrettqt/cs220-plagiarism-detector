I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people , I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean .
If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight .
Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period .
Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems , but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down .
I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable , and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something , but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance .
I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class .
I 'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore .
You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look .
They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of
