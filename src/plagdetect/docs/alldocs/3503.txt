Censorship is a contraversal topic .
Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree .
My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary .
Everyone is entitles to what they believe , and others have to have the maturity to accept that .
Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it .
It is as simple as that .
Everyone can be offended by something , so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left .
If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section .
Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject .
It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship , my view be just one of many .
Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material .
The only person who can let you be offened is yourself , therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it .
