I feel that it should be censorship in libraries.Children shouldnt be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to.This could save people from getting in trouble and reading thye wrong stuff .
There should be censorship in libraries.I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.One other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching , you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @MONTH1 be.Thats why if we had censorship , they wouldnt have a chane to do so.Another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public , and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library .
As you can see , these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.They already have book stores and online site , where u can buy books and movies , and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.That way , they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.So with that being said , I feel there should be censorship in libraries .
