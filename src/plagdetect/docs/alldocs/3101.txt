No , i do not think that books , magizines , movies and music should be removed .
However , I do think that the books , magizines , movies , and music should be monitred by age .
The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening , or watching material that is for adults or teenagers .
They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card .
The card could have their name , age , grade , and date of birth .
If there is a certain book , magizine , movie , and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them .
The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent is of age .
Teenagers should also be moniterd .
Event though they are almost adults .
Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material .
So , if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards .
Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching , or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading , watching or listening to
