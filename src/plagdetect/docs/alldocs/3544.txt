There are some movies , books , music , etc that @MONTH1 be found offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive , then you shouldn't have read the book.Books , music , and movies are made to entertain you , however , if you are not entertained then what you 're reading or watching is not for you !
I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie , and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way , also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie , I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader , however , there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion , and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf , and you find it offensive , it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book , and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking , and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader , but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it .
In conclusion , I feel that if you are offended by a certain book , type of music , or movie you should learn from the movie , and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books , music , movie , etc are made to entertain , not to offend .
