Parents are responsible for their child , whether it's taking them to school , making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads .
Libraries should not remove 'offensive ' books , magazines , movies , etc .
That is the parents reponsibility , it's the library's .
The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine , ect .
Whether it's for enjoyment or research .
That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read .
If we took out all the material in the library that some people , in there oppion , found offensive , then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library .
Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow ?
If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book ?
Or even teach them that those books are wrong .
The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes .
How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong .
If the kid is young , the parent would be the one taking their child to the library , so they could easily watch which book , magazine , or movie they 're picking out .
Most libraries have a children's section anyway .
It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child , it's the parents .
Their job is to supply the community with books , movies , magazines , etc .
Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read .
