There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences .
By marking movies with a rating , and marking books with a specific age group , it helps categorize them .
In our public libraries , all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out .
There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone .
If a child were to check out a book , and it happened to be rated @CAPS1 , the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie .
There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating .
In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out .
Furthurmore , should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate ?
The logical answer concludes to no , they shouldn't .
If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre , why should they be able to check them out freely at the library ?
Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials .
By simply having their age on their library card , there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of .
Our public libraries should take it into their own hands , by changing their censorship .
It would give them a better name , and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials .
