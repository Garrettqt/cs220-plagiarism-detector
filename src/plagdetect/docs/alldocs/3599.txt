Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it ?
Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like .
We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there .
She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting , pictures and even comments .
We got all of the magazined anf threw them away .
In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies , music , and magazines should be remove .
They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth , and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes .
They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it , this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school , friends and even moms .
We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie .
The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it .
We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing .
So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off .
That why i think they should be remove
