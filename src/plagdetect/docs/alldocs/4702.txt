I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library .
If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library .
The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech , and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write .
If somebody did not want their children looking at a book , or reading that book , then they should just tell their child to stay away from it , and if they raised their child properly , he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set .
However , I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library .
Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational , such as @ORGANIZATION1 .
On the other hand , I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either .
There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures , and those that educate them about sex and explicit material .
It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that .
But they can do it in another way , other than taking the book off the shelf .
Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity , the concerned parent can not just take actions into their own hands .
The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library , not the customers .
I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library , you should bring it to the attention of the owner , or simply go to a different library .
If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much , you could go to court and plead your case to the judge .
But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you .
