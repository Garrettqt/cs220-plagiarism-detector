I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's .
Katherine is correct in many ways .
We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked .
The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds .
I 'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored .
I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they , sometimes , help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women .
now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book , because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is .
Music is freedom of speech , some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters ' , 'idol's ' , and even 'love spreading ' , yes their are some songs that could be 'seem ' offensive but you 'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled ' @CAPS4 ' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone .
People learn special , powerful life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way , we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future .
