Do you think books , magazines , or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries ?
In my opion , I think that the boss or manager of the stores should removed the books , magazines , or movies from the shelves stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids .
Today I will inform you @NUM1 reasons why boss or managers should removed books , magazines , or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids .
One reason , why the boss and managers should removed books , magazines , or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that some times kids go the stores and when the parents are about to pay what they are going to buy kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probaly the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they should not be looking at and the parents do not but attention to what their kids are looking .
Another reason , why the boss and managers should removed the books , magazines , or movies from the shelves of the stores and labraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote someting about thier culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition.My last reason why boss or managers should removed the books , magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when I go to labraries and I see this little kids waching at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate I get questinable and in my mind I said 'why the boss or mangers don't removed the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or inappropriate and that might be something bad to show them .
If the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines.In conclusion , I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should removed the books , magazines , or movies from the shelves stores and libraries because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids .
