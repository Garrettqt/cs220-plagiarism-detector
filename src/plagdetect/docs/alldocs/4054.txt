The @CAPS1 , I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author .
The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf .
But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
of the shelf of a library , or anywhere else those items are displayed .
So I agree % @NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions .
Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people .
I have observed people , and were all different so why should our thoughts be to ?
The answer is yes they should be different .
But it is pretty simple if you find a book , song , movie , or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting .
I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said .
I am asking for your help to do so .
I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it .
Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4 .
