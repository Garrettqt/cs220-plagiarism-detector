People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics .
But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter ?
Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to .
Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books , music , movies , magazines , tv shows , ect .
The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them .
Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities , races , ect .
When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious .
Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it .
Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read .
Casue like i already said there are gon na find out about this stuff eventually .
So no need getting mad over it .
And if we got rid of all the more mature books what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read .
Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home .
