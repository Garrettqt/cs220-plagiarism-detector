It really don't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me .
But a library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is devided up in sections for kids , young adults , and adults .
If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it , or check it out .
Just because one person don't like it dont mean someone else dosn't .
Librarys don't make people look at or check out something they don't like .
so why are people complaining about it .
They are getting to checkout books , movies , and music for free unless it becomes over due .
So people stop complainging about what the library has on there shelves .
