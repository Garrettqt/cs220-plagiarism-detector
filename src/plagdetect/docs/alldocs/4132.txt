Shut down libraries ?
Yes , I do , because music , movies , etc .
could not only contain unnessisarry attire , they could also contain potty mouth language .
The words could , and can , corupt the minds of youngsters .
All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers .
The things they do to make some cash around here , do you agree with me ?
They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader .
Still , they put all of these things in the same building .
They should put up sales for kids ' movies not adults , but the librarians say 'books are books ' .
I think I 'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries , thank you very much .
However , because some have dull enviornments , or lack of customers , some libraries close down .
Make use of that thought I just told you .
I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish .
But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones , or being replaced by some family stories .
If a little kid were to listen to some cursing , his/her mind will be warped for life .
What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby .
How about saying ' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ?
.. '
or ' @CAPS4 that ball , you meanie ! '
?
Maybe THAT will give some education .
However , some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language .
Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all .
Your honor , I have my proof right here .
I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1 .
