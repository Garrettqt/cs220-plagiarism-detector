The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want .
Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information .
People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it .
Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else , for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it .
Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs .
Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them .
I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that .
There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books , magizines , music , and movies about racialism .
I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color , they have just as much right to be here as we do .
Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate .
Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives .
And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go .
