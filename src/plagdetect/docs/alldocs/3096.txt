I belive that they need to keep every thing and gain more .
Their is so much to luearn about .
The more information you have the better .
I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information .
Thow you can not trust every thing in one , You can still find many facts about what your wanting to learn about .
On the other hand , Children should not be able to reach or see some of this .
I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about .
The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids wont get in it and we can still lurean and find out new things .
Not everything should be hidden .
The more you know could just save the world .
