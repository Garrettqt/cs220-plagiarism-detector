Should we take off books that are offensive ?
I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive .
If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self .
If all of us could take off the book , movie , or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books , movies , or music on the self .
First off all , there will be no war books , movies , or music on the self .
All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war .
They will say that it infensive on them on take them off .
I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake .
If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost .
Secondly , all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self .
All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done .
It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it .
If they take them down how can the football players , solders , and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight .
Finally , they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms .
Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise .
Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company .
All of this is why i don't want this to happen .
All the good music , books , and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad .
