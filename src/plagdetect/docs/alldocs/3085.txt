I beleive that certian things such as books , movies , music , magazines , etc.
, should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf .
The reason i think that they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them .
If people don't like them , or they think that it is offensive , they shouldn't go to that library .
I don't get offended by anything .
When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the things that they have on the shelfs .
Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing .
People that read things and get offended by it , should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not .
The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete .
It might not be good for the eyes of people .
I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them .
So that way noone is making a big deal about what is on the shelves .
