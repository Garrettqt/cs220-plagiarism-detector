I believe certain materails such like books , music , movies , and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate .
Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways .
But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker .
I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book .
When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report ' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse .
So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong .
So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan ' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything , but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head .
As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as ' @CAPS2 books ' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing .
Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2 , drugs , and gangs .
Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence , abuse , harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older .
I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older .
