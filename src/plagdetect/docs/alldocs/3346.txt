Should books , magazines , or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves ?
I think that the book , magazine , or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive .
If it is offensive to one person , it doesn't mean that it is to every person .
Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not .
I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive .
They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine .
But , they shouldn't argue over it because , like I said before , the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive .
In conclusion , the books should stay on the shelves .
Everyone has different point of view .
The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive .
