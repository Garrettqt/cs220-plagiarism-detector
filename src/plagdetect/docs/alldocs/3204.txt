Dear newspaper and staff , @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary .
I find this not accepable ; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations .
For example , a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1 ' , this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics .
Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been .
Some topics @MONTH1 include ; slavery , abuse , war , and discrimation .
These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society .
Censoring and removal of these book are pointless ; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue .
@CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships , problems , and lessons in which these topics araised .
Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history , which we as a country are trying to prevent !
My opinion on movies however are a little different .
I believe some movies are okay ; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material .
Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating .
They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie .
So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues .
I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages , depending on the content .
Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed .
I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter !
Thanks !
Sincerly , @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1
