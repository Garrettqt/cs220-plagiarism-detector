I believe that libraries should not censor their literature , all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered .
No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know .
The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries .
That right should remain with every single person , so they can decide whats right for them .
Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books , music , movies , and magazines .
With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures .
Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes , to ensure that they don't happen again .
The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it .
Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever , but we can still learn so much from it .
It @MONTH1 make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it .
It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person @MONTH1 find immoral and wrong someone else @MONTH1 be able to learn from it some how .
If you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it , not get rid of it for everyone .
Our media is very powerful and should not be censored .
Media has an unbelieveable impact on the world , so we should not try to hide some of it .
We have not even seen half of what media can do
