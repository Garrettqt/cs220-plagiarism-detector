Dear newspaper editor , @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1 .
This doesn't seem like a big problem to some , but a very major problem for others .
Censorship has removed books , music , magazines , movies , and other things , from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers .
Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases , but its not about what they like .
Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject .
Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems .
Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell ?
In most cases , no .
The belief in a religon or even a book , magazine , or movie that had one small comment about ; sex , drugs or alchol is removed for just that .
If we remove everything about any of that , the only thing left @CAPS3 be childrens books .
Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well .
We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books , magazines and other things of that nature .
Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work !
What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf ?
Then another and another , we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores .
This censorship is a major problem , very few people really care about this subject .
Most think it should be done to most items , some think we dont need to censor anything , as we are a free country .
So newspaper editor , please question yourself , ask yourself , ' @CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines , books , and movies gone forever , never to be seen again ? '
Then everyone will know the answer .
