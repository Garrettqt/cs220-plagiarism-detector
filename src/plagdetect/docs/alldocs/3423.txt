'Should libraries censor reading material's to students at school .
'That is a yes an no quistion because reading is good for people of all age's its just is the topic suitable for certain age group .
Yes , I do think they should censor reading material , But to an exstent they need to have books for kids at certain age groups .
like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults .
if the child wants t read more graphic material then they must have pramission from their parent .
the reason i say that is there are things that get published by authord that are ment to be read by certain people .
