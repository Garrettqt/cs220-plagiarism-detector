As an individual and what books I have read , I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf .
My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books .
Kids should be kids and wait till they 're older and more mature to know about certain things .
This also includes music , movies , and magazines .
Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing , cussing , and even murder .
The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway .
We see bad behavior every day like stealing , cussing , murder , and assault .
Ever wonder what causes people to do it ?
Just look around you they show it in movies , they talk about it in books .
theres even songs about it , no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things !
If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results .
Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials .
They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they 're older .
In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf .
