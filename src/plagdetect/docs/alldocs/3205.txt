Everyone today gets offeneded daily .
So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day .
However , there are those minds , which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials , that should have a right to keep thier minds that way .
One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies .
The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public .
The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public , and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way .
Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material .
It , in my opinion and experience , corrupts both the mind and soul , and causes man to be things he is not by nature .
Men , who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage , often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time .
They are thus a hinderence to soceity .
But if they can not accsess the material , they then need something to do to fill that time .
In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf .
This thus leaves the labraries with a choice .
They can leave their library the way that they want , they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room , or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve .
Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up .
