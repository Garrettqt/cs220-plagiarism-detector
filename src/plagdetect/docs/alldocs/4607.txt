Do yo think censorship is a good thing ?
Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people ?

Public libraries are a great help for the community .
They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home .
Libraries do think about what information children view .
That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age .
Also its not always about what the library displays , but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read .
If to some people some information is offensive , to others it might not .
People will always have different points of view .
This materials can not be removed , they might be important in some points of our lifes .
All information is helpful in some way .
The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to
