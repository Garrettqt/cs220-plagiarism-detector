Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people .
People do still read or listen to it .
And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves .
I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves .
I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds .
It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people .
But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying .
I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read .
That's not the case for everyone though .
Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world .
It's an escape for them from everyday life .
Which I can understand why someone would want to escape .
Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on .
Which makes it more entertaining than a book .
So more people would rather watch a movie .
But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling .
And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is .
So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things .
But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it .
Like i said everyone is different .
So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well ?
