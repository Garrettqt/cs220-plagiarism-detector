Materials , such as books , music , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive !
It's a public library .
Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way .
Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something , whether it be a book , movie or magazine .
When people come in looking for some good information about something , they look forward to finding good tips , and not being let down .
Example , with something possibly about someone being racist .
That's dissapointment to some .
Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them .
It's not fair .
Now , to parents with children .
Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires , and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them ?
I highly doubt it .
Unless , you just don't care about what your kid reads these days , but to the ones who want their child having a good education , well , you understand my statement .
It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied , but instead are let down .
It does them no good , and it could make your community look bad .
Libraries are to help people with information , fun facts , and all around good resources .
So , please put the bad books , music , magazines , etc .
away !
