I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use .
In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject , backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences .
I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand .
I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries .
When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb .
Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster .
The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend .
Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books .
In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded the readers to understand the point I am trying to make .
I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work
