To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3 : Censorship , does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society ?
There has been much contreversy over this topic .
Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings , while others , over the same topic , believe the complete opposite .
They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity , which is where i stand on the situation .
@CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge , @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us .
Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same , unfortunately for many , the people that are like this , usually , have much power in the say of what comes and what goes , not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things .
My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too .
However , I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored ' material should not be censored at all .
There is one , count that , one situation where I feel censorship is necessary .
One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but ' * bleep * this , and * bleep that ' .
All other material , whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing , is acceptable .
There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words , to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2 .
Great @CAPS5 , @ORGANIZATION1 , he always has a message in his music , whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general , however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time , so you just hear ' * bleep * ' when @CAPS2 is on the radio .
By just that ' * bleep * ' , you can lose the message thats coming across .
Also , ever hear the phrase , 'equal rights ' ?
Well , shouldn't music and literature be a right ?
@CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments .
And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic .
I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today , if not then your loss .
Thank you for your time .
A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7 , @LOCATION1
