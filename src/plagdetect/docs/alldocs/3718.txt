If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same .
I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way .
One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it .
Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare .
Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people .
people killing others and be doing sexaule things .
People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer .
If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents .
Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books , tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong .
Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit .
Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs .
In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book Books can sometimes be more bad then good .
If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left .
