Libraries have all kinds of books .
Books for everyone .
I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people dont like it , or find it offensive , when others might like the author .
If there is a book in the library that you find displeasin simpley don't cheak it out just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day .
Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read .
Yes , there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults , but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough .
Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it .
Everyone has there own tast in reading , as everything else .
Libraries have sections for all ages .
With books for there age .
Like the childern's section is for little kid , and the adult section is for adults .
Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section .
Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they ' r doing .
Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading , watching , or listening to .
The libraries are doing just fine the way they are , and have been for years , and will for years to come .
So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it , or want there kid reading it .
Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you ' r liking .
People learn alot from books , so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then ?
Books are a great part of history .
Why get rid of you ' r history ?
It's just wrong .
Books shouold stay right where they are and belong .
