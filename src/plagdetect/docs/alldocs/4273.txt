Yes , I believe that books , movies , music , and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate .
People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner .
If people want to have heir things shown such , as movies or heard , such as music , it should be appropriate .
Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right .
Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies , or songs say to do .
Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things , they just want to be heard , or want attention .
When I listened to music or watched movies , I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger .
I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right .
People just want to get their voice out there , and to be heard .
I learned to get my voice heard , I needed to do it in an appropriate manner .
Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids , but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive .
I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way , and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff .
The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do )
