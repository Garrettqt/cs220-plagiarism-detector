Do I belive that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive @CAPS1 choice is no .
I have several reasons for that one is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or whats on there mind .
And that should be aceptable any where cause every on has their on opinion about what they like or read .
And if you feel that it offen you maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or what ever the case @MONTH1 be .
You can find something else to read that you 'll enjoy or your friends and family @MONTH1 like , @CAPS1 second reason is that you can learn from stuff that @MONTH1 offen you and any kind of way .
Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging there pants many white people that seen there pants below there waist had something negative to say about the young men .
They only jugde a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person , that they was talking about and one of the black males was a honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college .
And when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why .
He told them this is a free country I can do what ever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self .
So with @CAPS1 reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials , such as books , music , magazines , etc , should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
So I hope you enjoyed reading @CAPS1 essay .
