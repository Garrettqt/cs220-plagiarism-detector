I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material .
Its a library , a place where people go to get information .
If you dont want your kid , or kids reading , watching , or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read , listen to or watch any offensive material , untill they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it .
It is a library , and they are gon na have a wide variety of books .
I dont think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its to ghory or has to many curse words for your kid .
Not everyone gets offended by the same things , or the same material .
If you do then dont read that book or watch that movie , but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it .
Libraries are made for the community and the people in it , not just one person .
Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by .
This is what I think on the censorship on the book , movies , music , magazine , etc .
Its a library , they are going to have a bunch of material .
If you find something offensive , be mature , put it back and find something else to read , watch or listen to
