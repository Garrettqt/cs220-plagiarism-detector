A library is a place to go and find books , music , and other things .
It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people .
Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive ?
If books , music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves .
They should have a section for those certain kind of materials .
To accsess that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone .
Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf .
You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth .
So therefore thats why they would have to be removed .
I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons .
Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun .
Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs .
