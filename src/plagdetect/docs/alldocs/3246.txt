I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries , or places where young people can see it .
Things , such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it .
I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things .
I personaly have been in a movie rental shop , and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see .
Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight , and requested if wanted .
I also have a religious view on all of this .
I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop , or library ought to respect me and my religion .
@PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so .
We need to have the same aspect on life .
If something causes someone else harm we should not do it .
This is an issue that we face every day , and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere .
If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive !
I will say though , if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want .
I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them .
