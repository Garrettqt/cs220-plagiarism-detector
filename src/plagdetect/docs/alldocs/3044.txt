I don't Believe in censorship of libraries .
Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country , and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries .
It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not .
If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist , or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie , then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them .
Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here .
If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read , movies to watch , or music to listen to .
Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf .
But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left .
Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know .
which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1 , we wouldn't be free .
Censorship of libraries would take away our rights .
witch is why i apose it
