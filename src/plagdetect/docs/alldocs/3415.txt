No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive .
Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read .
I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it .
Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason .
The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or if it wasnt a good book to have .
I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it .
Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in ?
If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read .
I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section , go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read .
Theres something for everyone in a library .
This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves , no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive ' .
