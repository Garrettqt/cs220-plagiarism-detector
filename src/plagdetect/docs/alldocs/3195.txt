Library Censorship Everyone has their favorite book .
But if it offended someone , should he be allowed to remove it ?
Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves .
If we removed books that offended even one person , then no books would remain .
As americans , we have the right to freedom of speech .
Authors use their freedom in their writing , just like musicians use their freedom to make music .
But if we denied them their right to put out their creations , we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen .
Personally , I hate rap .
I don't even consider it to be music , due to the fact that no one actually sings .
But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it .
Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves , leaving teenagers without their music , denying artists ' freedom of speech , and ultimately , leaving them unemployed ?
One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series , by @PERSON1 .
It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1 , and it helped me do the same .
But because it is a @CAPS2 series , should it be removed from shelves ?
Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series , simply because someone might find it offensive ?
Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive , it isn't fair to the authors , musicians , or fans of those pieces of work .
However , those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it .
Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly , so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid .
Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone , which means they need to have materials for everyone , even though they might seem offensive .
