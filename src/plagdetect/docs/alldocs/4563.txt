There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently .
Many books , movies , and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive .
There are , however , libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive .
There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored , but libraries should not have to censor certain items .
One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie .
If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label , they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting .
Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents .
Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting .
If they believe the material is too mature for their child , they could restrict them .
If the item doesn't seem too harmful , they could allow it .
That decision , however , is up to the parents .
Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library .
Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision .
And that , again , is the decision of the child's parents .
There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned .
That sort of material , however , should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out .
