Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly .
In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences .
All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy ' they have been apart of .
You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with , that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can .
Opinions are alternated often about many different things , being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often .
In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way .
Exceptence is what ' key to making eveyone get along at some point , but people struggle with homophobia .
Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions .
It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree , but neither could live without each other .
It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree ' with you @PERCENT1 , unless there pretending to be something there not .
From life experiences from parents arguing , friends fighting , and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday .
All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see .
I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across .
It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through .
