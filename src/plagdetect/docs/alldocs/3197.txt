I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries .
In my opinion , it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing .
Also , it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults .
People are different in many ways .
It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction .
If they move books , music , movies , and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life , if they get taken off the shelves ?
Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else .
I just don't think that people would be to happy .
Also , they 're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that .
People would like to learn about different things .
If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves , there would be hardly anything to read .
Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things .
The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things , sometimes they can have more information in those books than others .
In my conclusion , censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people .
