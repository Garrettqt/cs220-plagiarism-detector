In today's world being a child isn ' @CAPS1 the easy thing , they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly , weather it is the stress of school or what there doing this @DATE1 .
But the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not .
I do not think that cencorship should be enforced more than it already is .
Although that parents , and the government would disagree , cencorship is going to do nothing but make out future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are .
Children shouldn ' @CAPS1 lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn ' @CAPS1 be so nieve about the world either .
So I 'm against censorship , because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered .
Censorship is already posted on music and movies , and it's not doing anything children are still goint to listening to music that isn ' @CAPS1 appropriate for their age , but they don ' @CAPS1 know the meaning behind the lyrics .
And cencoring movies and @CAPS1.V show aren ' @CAPS1 going to help much either , because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access thing more easily .
So unless we censore the internet to certian .
Which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world , because they will find out about certian thing sooner or later .
Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually , but it doesnt have to .
If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certian then cersorship wouldn ' @CAPS1 be needed
