Dear Katherine Paterson , Do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive ?
I honestly don't think that's nessecary because not everybody @MONTH1 find those materials offensive .
If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then dont read it or pay attention to it , don't take something from someone that they like .
I think that if there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive , that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it .
Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials , enless everyone agrees that it's offensive.That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic , just because one person found it offensive .
Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed , but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people @MONTH1 enjoy .
Let's say I enjoy movies , books , or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food .
Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else .
That's just there opinion on things and you can't always get what you want , so just deal with it .
Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive .
My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it .
Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people enless everyone agrees on it .
Sincerly , @PERSON2
