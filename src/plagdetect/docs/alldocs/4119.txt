I feel that books , music , movies , and magazines should not be removed from shelves .
Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive .
They only become offensive when people think they are .
I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to .
No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read .
Every one has the choice .
To choose what they want to read or watch .
what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang .
Another person .
@MONTH1 find interesting and exiting .
I have felt the same way before , but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf .
The next person after me .
Has as much the same right as I did .
The person has the right to watch or read what I have .
To like or hate what ever is on the shelves .
There are lots of things in a @CAPS5 .
Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive .
There are scary books like ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 . '
@CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther , @PERSON2 .
There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1 . '
@CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther , @PERSON1 .
So to some up my esay .
Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves .
Just because i or any one else finds them offensive
