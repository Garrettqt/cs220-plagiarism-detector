The author is writting about taking books off that the adult's don't want the book's the end they won't have book's to .
They take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them .
Well I don't really belive that they should take them out becuase they het intresting well some of them do .
Well I 'm not a fan of reading I dont really like reading but I have to anyway and I dont think it should be taking out .
I don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons it's better to have them so kids can read and learn bout the pictures .
Some book's aren't that bad to kid's like to elementary kid's the only book's they like are the one's with picture's in them .
The @CAPS1 school and middle school kid's like the chapter kind of book's and intresting book's .
The parent's would like them to have educational book's that will help the kid's learn new word's and school related stuff .
The book's the adult's want are the kind that have meaning to like have alot of knowledge and school realated stuff .
They want there kid's to learn about what they are reading .
But yea i din't think they should take out the bbok's that they have they shoul 'd just leave them for the kid's becuase there atleast are educational to them .
So the adult's would have more educational student's to relly on
