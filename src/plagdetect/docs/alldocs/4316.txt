I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books .
People should enjoy reading all types of books .
Some people only read different books .
Little kids like fantasy and picture books , teenagers like romance , and others like nonfiction .
It should not matter what other people think .
If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read .
Before you bring books off the shelves , you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right .
Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves .
What would happen ?
I will tell you , you would lose customers .
If you don't want children to read inappropriate books , then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books .
If that won't work , then make an age limit .
Have the parents show you their berth certificate .
Have a resticted section in the library .
In order to get a book from the resticted section , then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed .
Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines .
If their the age of fourteen and up , then they can get a magazine .
Music should not matter to parents , so there should be no problem there .
If the movies are bought by the parents , then there should be no problem there either .
The other things you can figure it out on your own .
This is what I think should happen to books in a library .
I told you how a library should work .
I told you what I thought should go on in the library .
I will give you some advise .
Think before you do .
That is all I am going to tell you .
