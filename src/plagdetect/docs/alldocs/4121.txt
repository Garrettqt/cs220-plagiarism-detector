Books being taken off the shelves ?
No way !
The @CAPS1 is the place to go if you want books , movies , music , etc.
, that fit what you like and want .
Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else ?
No , because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason .
Everybody is diffrent .
Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for diffrent types of information .
If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left .
What offends someone @MONTH1 not offend someone else .
For example , the libraries have information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history .
While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it , the information is also offending @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about .
But really if you think about it , its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about .
It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to .
When people go to the @CAPS1 they know , no matter what information their looking for , they will find it .
Isn't that whats so great about trips to the @CAPS1 ?
Looking and finding things you never learned about , even if it offends others .
All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject .
It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason
