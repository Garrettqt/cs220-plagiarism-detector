Is there enough censorship in our libraries ?
Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it ?
Well that should never happen , if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it .
Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see .
Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them .
Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read .
For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well .
The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them .
The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old .
So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers .
I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young .
That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library .
