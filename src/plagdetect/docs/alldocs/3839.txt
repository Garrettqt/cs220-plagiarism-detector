I am writing to the newspaper , about removing certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , and more .
I dont think this should be allowed .
I dont think it would be far to others .
I 'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves .
@CAPS1 first reason is that , what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little ?
But they took it off the shelves .
That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant .
Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf . '
@CAPS1 seceond reason is , what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song , but they took it off the shelves ?
That would be devistating , it would just break your heart .
Well I know it would me if it was are wedding song .
The last reason and @CAPS1 favorite reason is , you just have your own opion .
Everyone has thier own opion , if you dont want to see them or look at them just dont do it .
It's as easy as that , just try to ignor it .
It's really not your problem to worry about .
Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves .
Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS2 if we let this happen everyone will take avanege of it .
That is why I am @CAPS2 no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves
