People from all over the world have many different opinions .
If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it .
Therefore , I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it .
One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because , not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book , movie , magizine , or music is offencive .
People have their own opinions on everything , and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad , the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read .
Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because , some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library .
Many people like the offencive things in books , movies and soforth .
I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book , watching a movie , listening to music , or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not .
In my own opinion , I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today .
Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are .
It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny .
Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate , I believe that if they 're there then obviously there not too bad , and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library .
Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do .
