Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age ?
No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies , books , and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue .
My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way .
Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way .
Thats how people find out who they are such as , what their interested in , what they like , and what they want to do .
If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves .
People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others .
People should be aware of some of the content in books .
Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups .
Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use .
Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it .
It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it .
Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies , books , and cds restricted to a certain age group , but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking .
So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people .
