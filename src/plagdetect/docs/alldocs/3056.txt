Many books and material in libaries are sometimes offensive to certian people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libaries .
Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable intrest in another person .
If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away , then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like like , science .
If it is offensive to the general public , it should be placed in a special scection , be avaible behind the counter , or avaible only at specific libaries .
Throught the libaries of the world , there are two general sections , adult , kid , and entertaminet sectioons .
In these sections locate many topics and many views of ceartian things .
Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden ' from view and have to spend all day looking for it .
It should be that contreverstial topics should be kept in a closed off section of the libary and can be accesed by the staff so that way none of the pubic can worry .
Like cigarretes at a store , somethings should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchfull eye over it .
These subjects include sex , racisim , porn , polotics , and other material like the ones listed .
With these items behind the counter , people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view , but still acesiable with special order or request .
This would help the public .
Some material , when reached to a specific town , can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community .
Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be aquired at large libaries or specific book stores .
With material far away , people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community .
This is why some material should only have premettid acess under watchfull guard
