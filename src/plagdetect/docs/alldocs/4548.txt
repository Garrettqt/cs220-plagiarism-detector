No , I dont think that certain books , music , movies , maganzines should be taken off the shefls.If stuff like that gets taken off then there will be nothing good to read the book now day a starting to get good so if they take the good book then no one will read.Most people think that rap music is bad but that is the music that most people listen to now day and mosy people dont like country.There are some bad movies out there but they are fun to watch becaues there ether funn , gross , or they are sad but there bad movies are groess or funn .
If people made better magazines then they wouldnt have that much money then that buissness will go out of buissness and that not a good thing because the person that runns the buissness will have no money to feed his kids.Sence i have been alive nost of the good thing like books , music , magazines have changed because people dont like the stuff from a long time ago .
If they do it again then people will stop going to the movies and buying books so that wht i think .
Now there are alot of good movies and music coming out so if they brought back all the stuff they use to have then people would have more money.Why people would have more money is because more people would go se the movies from back in the old days.So like movie like from @NUM1 and even @NUM2 would make a lot mof monoey .
So that why i think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are loseing all hour money.The people are useing the that they would for movies or books and stuff they are useing for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff
