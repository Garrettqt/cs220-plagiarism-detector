First off , I do like censorship laws to an extent .
However , the government can not ban everything that they deem innapropriate .
I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate .
I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages .
I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content .
I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests , then they should just not look at it .
They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it , then they do not look at it .
However , if the library does not consent to holding the books , music , movies , magaines , etc.
, then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else .
And if they do have the books , music , etc.
, then they can put limits and ratings on them .
But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material .
As I said before , if they do not like it , then they are not required to look at it .
I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials .
One parent should not have the ability to take away others ' privilages to books , because they deem it innapropriate .
Just because they do not like the content , does not exclude all others from enjoying it .
Also , if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials , then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials .
However , if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent , then I think they should be able to view the material , regardless of ratings .
