I myself think that all books should be of the shelves because I do find some books to be offensive in their contents .
I also find it very annoying when people have books and you are trying to talk to them @CAPS2 all they do is ignore you @CAPS2 keep reading i find that disrespectful .
Myself though i do not like reading I find it to be boring @CAPS2 somtimes tireing unless it is actually a good book .
I also could say that some movies should be taken off shelves because they are so stupid @CAPS2 have no point such as harry potter , twilight and most other books that have mythical creatures in them .
Music on the other hand should @CAPS5 be taken off because it is alot easier to relate to and understand I @MONTH1 be wrong but thats my personal opinoin of the whole ordeal some music in the lyrics can show who you are and what you stand for in life music shows character @CAPS2 is easire to follow then movies or a boreing old book.I listen to music all the time you hardly ever see me with a book in my hands I sometimes do watch movies but they are more action , comady though I really don ' @CAPS10 like scary movies though I do watch some @CAPS2 I don ' @CAPS10 like ones with weird looking creatures in it thats just not what I look for in a movie .
I can list some books , movies @CAPS2 music I like , for instant twoo books I like are blood is thicker @CAPS2 untill we @CAPS4 again by @PERSON3 .
Movies I like are all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies , @ORGANIZATION2 , @CAPS4 The @PERSON4 and my all time favorite @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 And the new karoti kid .
Music I listen to consist of @CAPS8- @CAPS9 , @ORGANIZATION4 , @PERSON2 , @PERSON5 , @LOCATION3 , @CAPS10- @CAPS11 , @CAPS12 @CAPS13 , @ORGANIZATION5 , @LOCATION1 , @ORGANIZATION1 , @LOCATION2 , @ORGANIZATION3 , @CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 they are all great singer song writers and do a great job at what they do @CAPS2 make millions off of it I mean come on people love music more then anything .
there are movie music albums sold in the world the there are book and movies combind which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better .
Serveys have been taken music wins everytime .
So therefore this concludes my opinion on this subject and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books @CAPS2 movies are better because their not .
