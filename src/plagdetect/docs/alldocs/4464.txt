Dear , Katherine Paterson I was was thinking about if they items you listed to be taken offenisve , well I believe that its a free country and that all people should be treated equal , what im trying to get to is that the newpaper organization should keep doing what they do !
in fact should add more .
Yes their should be restictions on some things but to solve the under age buying just make people use their @CAPS1 !
By doing this I think this would solve alot of issues , taken it all away would be alittle to serious for just some magazines or moives.So keep doing what your doing just set a higher restiction on sells and things should be just fine !
from your dearly , zack
