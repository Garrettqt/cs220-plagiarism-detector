I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive .
The books and media help the human race sympathize with eachother and know about things that already happend so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again .
Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happend in the past.Taking books off the shelfs of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms .
Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you suceed in life .
some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn .
books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it .
some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't .
