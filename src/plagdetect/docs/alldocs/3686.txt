Cencorship The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship .
Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing ?
I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good .
The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad .
The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily .
Most people can handle alot of abuse , but on the otherhand alot of people can't .
In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor .
Such as political cartoon .
They make fun of the @CAPS1 and alot of the other people that are in office , but you dont see them complaining about it .
In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it .
That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again .
But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended .
Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies .
I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough .
most people can live with it , but others can't .
Such as @CAPS2 , there is a whole lot of @CAPS2 in the @LOCATION1 , and expecally in this time period .
where ever you go there is always some sort of @CAPS2 .
In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far .
and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves , but not everything
