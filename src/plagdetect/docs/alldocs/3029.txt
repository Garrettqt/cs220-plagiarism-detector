wow thats racist .
as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump .
yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people .
its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that .
everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them .
but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it .
life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you .
see now i have a since of humor .
when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself .
i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny .
to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why .
it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot .
but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it .
he wasnt offending you .
if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life .
somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body .
in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on .
and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run .
