Hello , I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library .
First , I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic .
I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others .
Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life .
Second , I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have .
I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults .
reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read .
Next , I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature .
Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group .
Finally , I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out .
Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children .
Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all .
Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing .
In conclution , I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold .
Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf
