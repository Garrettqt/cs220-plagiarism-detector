I think that certain materails should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book , or movie , or in music .
If we where to listin to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read .
For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it .
A person that @MONTH1 come in the library daily @MONTH1 want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes .
Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and there children were watching movies about gangs , drugs , and violence , the mother would want that movie removed from the library .
I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are cought watching it .
Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with there children.A way for the library to stop children from geting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched .
Many people like movies with drugs , and violence .
There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certian thing .
I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it .
And if they say there children watch it or read it without there permission then that is there fault and they should know more about what there young children are doing instead of trying to get that book , movie removed sometimes books and movies have very offensive languge but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world .
They want the movie or book to be as real as posssible .
