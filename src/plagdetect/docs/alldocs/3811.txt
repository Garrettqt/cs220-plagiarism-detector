Nearly every person has seen , heard , wrote , or said something that offended someone .
Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music , books , or movies .
While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing .
If someone finds something offensive , they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible , ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves , or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded .
When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library , that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared .
In this case , other people can still watch , hear , or read the book or magazine , movie , or music .
Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else .
A book or magazine , song , or movie could be offensive to a lot of people , so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary .
This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future .
Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened .
In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library .
In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness .
If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated , voted on , or hold their peace .
If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people .
When voted one it could stay or be removed .
Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well .
