I do not believe that movies , books , music , etc .
should be removed from shelves .
I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to , read or watch , everybody has their own level of maturity .
Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something , always have the right to tell them no , and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp .
People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves .
Whether it is books , movies or music , a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item .
It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults , but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level , it shoud be out for the choice to be up to that certain person .
Different people have different levels of maturity , so it is hard for one person or company to say what age level should or should not be using that material .
A lot of parents will disagree with this issue , because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days .
But at the same time , they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to .
People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child , but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material , because just because one person @MONTH1 find it offensive , does not mean that other people will .
If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more , it's that simple .
Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them .
Parents can censor what their children watch , and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic .
This proves that certain items , like books , movies , and music , should not be taken off the shelf .
