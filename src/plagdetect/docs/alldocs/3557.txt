What do I think about library censorship ?
I believe that there should be some censorship , but not too much censorship .
Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest .
Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries .
There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase .
Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials , so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials .
Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content .
They are strong , but not too strong to not be put in libraries .
Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure .
Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided , doesn't mean that the material should be taken away .
If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy .
Every person has their own taste in materials , be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame ' materials .
Everyone is inclined to their opinions , but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library .
I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries .
Some strong materials , some more 'tame ' materials .
It all depends on the persons own interests and choices .
Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I 'm looking for something in a library and it's not there , because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment .
In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries , but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them .
Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment , but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions .
