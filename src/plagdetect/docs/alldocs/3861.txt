Why Should you be offended ?
The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason , what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to .
Everyone has there own taste .
Books , movies , music , and magazines are made for people to look at , read , watch .
ect .. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it .
Libraries are great use for that .
People go to get what they like to watch , read , and listen .
And other people should not get offended by what other like .
Most Libraries are organized into sections for children , young adults , and adults .
If there is material that you don't think is 'ok ' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section .
But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it .
How is that fare to others who might like it .
If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok ' then it ok for it to be moved to another section .
You don't have to look at something if you don't like it .
Someone else might like it .
Libraries are made for all people , and everyone has there own taste .
Don't be offended by what others like .
