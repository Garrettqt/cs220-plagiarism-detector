I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found innapropriate .
There are several things that explain why I think this .
For one thing , some libraries don't have certain genres of books .
For example , say one library @MONTH1 have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action .
If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship , people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores .
Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was innapropriate , unless they 're given approval by parents .
If these materials were to still be on shelves , you should at least be a certain age to read it , unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first .
Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly , but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words .
Lastly , some adults would be upset of the removal of some books .
Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library .
If they were to remove these books , adults would then have to find a book online .
So censorship , to me , is not going to make any difference .
If this continues , it @MONTH1 lead so far , that the libraries would have to be closed .
Take my word for it .
In conclusion , don't let censorship take over our libraries .
