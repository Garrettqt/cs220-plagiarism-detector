Many people have different views on censorship .
Some people believe there are movies , books , newspapers , etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all .
Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want , on a topic they believe the be true or not true , or very improtant to them , also called freedom of speech .
Also people believe that yes , there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate .
I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate .
But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me , another person will .
I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things .
If people had the power to control what books , magazines , newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right , 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us ' .
Certain books , newspapers , movies , and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age .
If the story is plainly about drugs , sex , alcohol , and voilence with really no use to it , then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf .
You do not know who could get their hands on that movie , book , or article .
It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that .
People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone , but I also do believe there is a certain extent .
