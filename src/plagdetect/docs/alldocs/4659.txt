'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
Katherine Paterson , an author , once said .
I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read .
I agree with her on that statement .
I have once read a book with very mature content .
It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity .
There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society .
They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as : war , violence , sex , drugs , and all sorts of other things .
If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives .
There would be less teen pregancies , drug ussage , and multiple other factors that are effecting our society .
Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media .
I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though .
We should just keep them out of the libraries .
If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere .
An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries .
A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media .
But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to .
This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media .
But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you , don't read or watch it .
