I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive ' .
Something that is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be offensive to another .
Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate , somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate .
The main issues that most people have with books are foul language , sex , and difference in opinion .
These three catagories are very sensitive issues , some @MONTH1 not be comfortable disscussing these issues .
Many books in the library systems today contain foul language .
Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section .
I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading .
In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency .
Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines .
Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination , and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions .
Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends .
Religion , politics , and morals can lead to some nasty debates , but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree .
Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way ?
Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don '' t agree with what it says ?
Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries ?
I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves .
If you don't agree with the book then don't read it .
Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read , perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they arn't reading something they shouldn't n't
