Some books in libraries offend others .
So should they be removed ?
That is the point im going to get across today .
Keeping people under self-control is top priorities for the public .
So why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups ?
Graphic and gorey books are books usually that disgust people but should all contain a warning symbol on it for people with weak stomachs and those who just can't handle it .
So by that means , I 'm fine with it .
People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there .
This is my take on the whole situation .
So people , if you can't take the heat , stay out of the kitchen .
However offense material to races , religions , and other personal aquisitions , is something of different concerns .
This can certainly inflame groups , and even start protest or boycotting it .
Authors in some cases need to review their materialand make sure it won't cause any disruption .
Inflaming the public is not what you want young authors .
This can not only make the public upset , but can possibly lead to the author getting fired .
False statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy .
Not only will it cause a stir up in the press , but just like the race/religion thing , it can cause the author to be fired .
This is not what the author wants .
So making sure the work is true and not hipotheticle is a good step .
These are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence .
So inconclusion , authors have lots on their hands .
All the way from race issues , religion , fale statements , and so on .
These are some of the things authors want to avoid .
Making the public recommend the book , and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for
