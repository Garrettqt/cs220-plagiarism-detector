I think that books , magazines , papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them .
Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having .
@CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed .
Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems .
If the books etc are offensive then , the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them .
The can't control what books are in the library .
Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them .
Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive .
Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont .
If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it .
@CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2 .
For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with .
If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2 .
I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it .
Im sure that they wont do anything about it .
The books and other things are there for a reason , 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2 ' , and to understand what there life is and how to fix it .
You have to control under the books .
You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf .
In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it
