I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week .
Although I don't really read that much .
I usualy get movies or music .
If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school .
I don't think that books should be removed .
If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't .
If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that .
For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf .
Other people might want to read it .
It's there choice to read it not mine .
It's like the radio know .
The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words .
I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words .
The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words .
To me I don't think thats right .
It's also like telivtion now .
You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them .
When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge .
To me I think every thing should stay .
I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people .
If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio .
Theres no need to take the words out .
Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way .
I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax
