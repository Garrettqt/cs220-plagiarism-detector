When I walk into a library to look for a book , I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books , movies , or magazines .
When I see that , I think , ' @CAPS1 if a child saw this ? '
I would like a library for my child to visist without me worrying about the things they could see.To fix this problem , the libraries could do a number of things .
First off , the libraries could censor @CAPS1 they put out on the selves .
By putting the adult books section by the check out place , an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section .
If that soultion does not work , then try and rate the sections like we rate movies .
Put @CAPS2 books and movies together , @CAPS2- @DATE1 books and movies together , @CAPS4- @CAPS5 books and movies together , and so on .
One time , when I took my baby brother to the library , he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out .
I was shocked and embarrassed .
I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library , but it did .
I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice .
So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed , but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff .
