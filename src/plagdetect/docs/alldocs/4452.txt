Should books , music , magazines , etc.
, be removed form shelves that are found offensive ?
Everyone has their own oppion on that question .
In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable .
I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it .
Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves .
While growning up our parents try to keep us from things , at that point in life don't need to see .
I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything .
Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own ?
You would probably get multiple answers to that question .
My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me , but I think you should be able to have the right to read , see , and litsen to what you want .
The world is not a safe place , its scary and mean to the people .
When I raise my children , when they 're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see .
But thats just part of raising your kids , when they get older and start asking quesions i 'm going to answer with the truth .
Is keeping these things from our children lying to them ?
I would have to say yes to that question .
By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there , that the world is perfect and there is no wrong .
Some people would actually say that , but I have to say to them that they haven't lived .
Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself .
To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want .
We shouldn't , not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world , and have a complete culture shock .
Teach your children whats out there , let them know the truth about the world .
Should certain materials be removed from shelves ?
No , @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear ?
