I do not think that books , movies , music , magazines , etc.
, should be removed just because some people do not like them .
Maybe some others do like them and like to read them .
There should be no reason that one person or persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive .
Many people like many different things and somethings that you read @MONTH1 affect others , but you dont care about that , you just care about what you want and like and what is offensive to you .
What if something you were watching or reading or listening to was offending someone else , would you care ?
Would it bother you if someone told you it was affending them ?
Everyone likes different things , and some others @MONTH1 not always agree with what they are going to be interested in
