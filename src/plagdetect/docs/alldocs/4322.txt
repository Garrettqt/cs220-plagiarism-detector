Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraies shelf .
No , because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at .
Like if you have kid's you should keep them and a kid's area .
We can not just start takeing down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book.The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them .
We will need the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them .
Some books are @CAPS1 for kid's to read .
so thats why they have there on area to be in .
Kid's should not leave there area for a @CAPS1 book .
I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary .
The @CAPS1 book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book .
i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will .
but like movies , music , and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was @CAPS1 it would not be and the libriary and the first place .
Everybody is not going to like everything but thats just life
