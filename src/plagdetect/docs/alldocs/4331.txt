I have seen some turely a offensive books on the sheilf of libraries .
Book that make you worry about what would happen if a child @NUM1 , @NUM2 , or @NUM3 looked at thes books since that is where their mind absorbs the most knowledge but what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a persons religion .
This childern are the furter of are species .
This should be censored in libraries .
Tried to a imagine if they had looked at books writen @CAPS1 and other nazi members during nazi @CAPS2 rule .
Mabey they looked at a book by @PERSON1 or other famours killers .
If they saw photo book about the massive jew death camps in europe .
Movies that show war torn battle such as @LOCATION1 , @LOCATION2 , world war @NUM4 , or world war @NUM5 .
The famours movie 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ' a movie based on the crulty of the @ORGANIZATION1 and the @CAPS5 .
This is my view on censorship to protect childern from the a offensive things in or on books , music , movies , magasines .
Their should be censored in all things childern can get in to .
Imagine the world where the was no corntal media what they could put on
