I believe that certain materials , such as books , movies , magazines , etc , should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things .
Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2 , @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be .
There are many other options , @CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not .
I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be , They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises .
So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property .
