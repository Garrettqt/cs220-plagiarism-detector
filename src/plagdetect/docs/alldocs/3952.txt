First of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it , no matter what your age is .
Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf , but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not .
If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs , Then it shouldn't be their , @CAPS1 my oppinion .
Parents @MONTH1 think differnt , parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray .
@CAPS1 not their choice though .
Anything is alowed to be at a libray .
If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's , then when your kid goes to the libray go with them .
Help them pick out a book .
In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf .
Kid or if your an adult .
If your not alowed to get , then why is it their ?
I dont know i couldnt anwser that question , other than why is it their ?
@CAPS1 my oppinion though
