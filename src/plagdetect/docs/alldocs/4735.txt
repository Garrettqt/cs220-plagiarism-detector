I think that if the books , music , magazines , or movies you have in a library is not offensive , then they have the right to put them on the shelfs.Theres nothing wrong wit havin music and magazines at a library because what if someone doesnt like to read but loves listening to music or doesnt like to read books but likes to read magazines.I think its all right to have movies too.They could have alot of educational movies of just some plain regular movies of all kinds.Now if a book or movie or magazine or music was found and it was offensive then they should be takin off the shelf.If the books , music , movies , or magazines are not offensive in any way , they have the right to be on does shelfs so everyone can use them .
