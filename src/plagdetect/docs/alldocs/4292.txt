There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at .
It's like the adult section at the library .
Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves .
I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people .
It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended .
Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them , but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people .
The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that .
Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing .
Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library .
So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library .
