In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason .
Some of the books take race , sexism , bullying , ect.
, to extreme .
Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books , magazines , movies , music , ect.
, would have to be scary .
The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are .
Would you want your child , that's @NUM1 , to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do ?
Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now ?
Well , these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now .
Taking some books off a shelf , or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit .
These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex , smoke , drink , or even cuss .
I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3 , because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was , or if i had any problems today .
If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place .
Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore ; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol .
You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life .
Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex , drugs , and profanities .
So , the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it .
Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it .
Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong .
Lets make these profanities go away on their own .
If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either
