Have you ever been offended by a movie , book , song , or magazine ?
Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item ?
The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves .
I don't think they should .
I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie , book , or magazine and all of them could give an example .
I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad .
If something offends you , don't read or watch it .
If you don't want your kids watching something , don't let them .
You can make that desicion .
No one is making you watch or read any of that .
I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have .
I 've even read some books that are not the best , but I choose to read them .
No one forced the act on me .
Some of you @MONTH1 ask , ' @CAPS1 about at school ? '
If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it , then take it up with the teacher .
They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book .
They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature .
There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there .
If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time , you probably wouldn't have much of a library left .
The shelves would be bare .
You have a choice to read or watch something .
If it is offensive don't watch it .
Everyone has different views on that book or movie .
It @MONTH1 be offensive to you , but to the next person it might be a really good show .
I don't think offensive books , magazines , music , or movies should be taken off the shelves .
