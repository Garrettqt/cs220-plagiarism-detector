Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive .
Yes , I know they are about thing that happen in history .
Other books are not , some more than others .
They are about killing , shooting , doing drugs , ect .
First , I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal , do drugs , or anything of that sort .
I ' v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries .
The kids might think they are good books to read , I think other wise .
Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them .
Secondly , @CAPS1 are fun to read , i know they are .
You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but , letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people .
If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books , music , movies , and magazines out .
@CAPS2 not up to me , it takes more than one person to do that .
It would ' n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way i am .
Next , @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to .
As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to .
Im just saying what i think would be right .
Not everone think's the same .
People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch , and lesson to all kinds of music and movies .
As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay .
Lastly , @CAPS3 kids be kids .
Have them grow up the way they want to grow up .
Yes , that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me .
At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books .
