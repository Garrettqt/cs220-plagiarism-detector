I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries .
I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question , because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading .
I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects .
Though books this material can be called offensive , to certain people this is there culture and how they live .
What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves ?
Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial .
The eye-opening world of these books is amazing .
The fact that I can read about other peoples life , and their everyday struggle is astounding to me .
If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion , then our world would be a mess .
Therefore , if all of these 'offensive ' books were to be removed , then what is left to read .
I want to read something that is going to grab my attention , and make me want to keep reading .
I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed .
