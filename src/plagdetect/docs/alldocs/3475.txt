I as a student , a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book , should be allowed in any library .
Books , express feelings , emotions ect.
, the same thing with movies , music .
I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world .
Each book out there has an explanation , a title and a reason to be read .
Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there .
I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different .
It doesn't matter what the books about , some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike .
There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things , for example certain people , animals , countries , different skin colors , cursing and even sports .
We all have our own opinions , if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it , others might like it .
Movies , books , music , magazines , etc.
, should be allowed anywhere
