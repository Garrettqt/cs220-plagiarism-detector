I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else .
In libraries there are books , music , movies , magazines , etc , some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it .
Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things .
Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive .
But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right .
Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas .
Everyone is not the same .
If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest .
If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing .
Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive .
Lastly , those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion .
But so are those that believe that these things are good .
There should remain a variety of different books , music , and other things that appeal to all types of personalities .
Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something .
But what you dont like someone else does .
So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust .
