Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day : fictional and nonfictional , horror and comedy .
Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams .
Being an author , who has the right to freedom of speech , story plots become to have endless combinations .
Every reader seeks out a different style .
Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings , any kind , every kind .
Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth , kind and cover , each category holding about four options .
The necessity for censorship should never be an option .
Writers compose for all sorts of people .
For some to say what's 'right ' or 'wrong ' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf .
If , perhaps , more books had ratings such as movies do , an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity .
Taking away the enjoyment for some readers , however , is unethical .
Whether pertaining to books , music , magazines , etc.
, censorship is unnecessary .
Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation .
If the worry is concerning youth , parental guidance should be in affect .
Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options .
To each , its own .
