No , I dont think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless , to some people @MONTH1 find everything offensive and others @MONTH1 not find it offensive like me personally stuff people find offinsive I find it kind of humorous .
And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity .
But other than that there should be no censorship it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policys it makes some people wan na go there less to get what they want and who knows the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored .
And I understand that when you have a kid you dont want them to fo the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible .
But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens .
From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view .
Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things , so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so that seems like a suitable age for early privelages .
When it comes to taking items off a shelf some peole have worse judgement than other people and that can effect everyone from their bad judgement .
