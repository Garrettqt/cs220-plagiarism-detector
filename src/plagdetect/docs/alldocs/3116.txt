I think that if there are books , music @CAPS1 , movies , or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive .
The reason why I think this is , because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff .
I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar .
I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions .
The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies , books , music and magazines then they should come off the shelf .
Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things .
They can see bad pictures , nudity , drugs and violence .
They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them .
For example pictures of weed , cocaine or pills are in books .
The kids can look at this stuff and see violence .
For example they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example .
We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read , watch , and listen to .
It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing .
The library is a place where many people go to learn .
It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them
