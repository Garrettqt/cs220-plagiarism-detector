I don't believe that any certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc ; Should be removed from the libraries shelves , because any thing can be offensive .
What if someone needed to resourch about the @NUM1 ?
Well they really won't be able to , if all the books about @NUM1 were taken off the shelves , only bacause someone found it offensive .
Now days , everything is offensive to somebody .
For this , people need to understand that it is what it is , and if you were not appart of that problem , then what do you need to worry about .
This day and age is evil all around the world .
There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive .
Just like all the earthquakes around the world , I know that there is some people offensive about that , but what if somebody was in college , and they wanted to learn more about what happened , so maybe they can get a group of people , and make there lives better .
People are hurting and I understand that , but us people are not here to judge , we are here to help the poor , and the sick , get by with what they have , and just help them see that there is a way out .
With all this said I don't believe that we should remove the books , music , movies , and magazines off the shelves in libraries .
