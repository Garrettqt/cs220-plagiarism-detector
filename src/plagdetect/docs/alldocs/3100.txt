I strongly disagree .
I think that materials should don't be removed from the library .
@CAPS1 all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.All the materials , such as books , music , movies , and magazines , cd's .
should don't be removed from the library .
I got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf .
like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do , so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.But when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house , i go to the library to find some intresting books.But when the libraries or the school got offensive books , magazines , movies , ect.
, i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library , @CAPS1 is not good for the children's , like when they want to read a book , like cartoon or animal book , and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad .
And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book , or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff , the parents are going to get mad , not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated .
that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school , @CAPS1 they respec us too .
tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials , my parents are going to get mad with me , they are going to said that if i don't have respec , and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me , that i bring my family to a offensive place , and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why
