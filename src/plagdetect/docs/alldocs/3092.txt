Do you think there should be any books movies madaines etc tooken off the shelfs ?
Will if so then you should read my newspapper actle .
I don't think that there is any books etc , that i would take off the shelfs .
There are many books etc that kids should read , but you can tell your kids not to read them , or if they do start to read them take the book away from them .
There are some books that kids shouldn't read , but only you can stop them from reading them .
They willl always try to find away to get what they want .
so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good , because they 'll find the book movie ets somehow .
The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch , and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do .
In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out , but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you don't want them to be around
