All people have the same right to read , listion and watch different materials .
To be censored should be no one choise but your own .
For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do .
If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly .
Any givein word can offend any certain person .
The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self , the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another .
It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings .
In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive .
I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech .
We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it ?
Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs ?
I have no idea why any person would want to take books , music , movies and magazines away from us .
If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1 .
Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves .
The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves , not to listen to music , And pick up the magazine .
the right is ours and thats how is should stay
