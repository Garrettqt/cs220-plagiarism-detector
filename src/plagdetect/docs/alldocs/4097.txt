@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back .
Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all .
If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4 .
Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4 .
And yes , We all know that most people these days don't usually share .
To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want .
Either get over @CAPS4 .
Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion .
We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree .
Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like ' @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 . '
No , I do not believe that books , music , and etc .
should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you 'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6 !
?
I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book .
I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music .
Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing .
So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1 .
'
@CAPS7 life ' @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I 'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager .
So basically I 'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying .
You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree
