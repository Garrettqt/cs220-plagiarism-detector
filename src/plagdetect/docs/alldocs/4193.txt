Do I think certain materials like books , music , movies , and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries ?
Of course not , there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country .
Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody .
Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1 , although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period .
That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history .
What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish ?
Absoulutely nothing is what , racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now .
Music and movies are forms of expression aswell , and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it .
You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies .
Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature .
People just take everything so literally these days , they got to have their part in anything and everything .
When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all .
That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news .
