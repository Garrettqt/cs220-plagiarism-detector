A library is a place you can go to read , write , and relax .
Nowadays , many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there .
Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship .
Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy .
First of all , removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted .
If they offend you then do not read them .
It is as simple as that .
Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs .
A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series .
@PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide ; however , it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs .
Therefore those people boycott the series .
I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released .
While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing .
Now most people would think that it was only a storm , but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party .
They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong .
I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it , but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book !
Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content .
For a while , @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school , but then the 'morality police ' banned it because it was about a crazy person .
Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards .
Consequently , what Katherine Paterson states is true .
If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable , eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library .
Although there could be a way to compromise .
If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that , then it could benefit both sides .
In conclusion , eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all , especially children .
When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read .
While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read .
Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes .
Books are a gateway to another world .
Why take that magic away from children
