Should we remove books and media because they are offensive ?
I do not believe so .
In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way .
The word offensive is a contreversial word .
Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting .
Many people see many different things .
Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive ' to older generations .
That is because today's standerds are different .
Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want , making offensive a changed word .
If a book , song , or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children .
Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people .
Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it .
So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive , because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person .
