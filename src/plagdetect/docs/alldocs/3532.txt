This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive , should be removed from shelves in libraries .
I think that overall , anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries .
I think that if they are very offensive , then they should be taken out ; but if they are just mildly offensive , then i think they should stay .
Because the library welcomes people of all ages , materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults .
But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there , they can end up finding something that can be offensive .
If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive , then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good .
So if they just take any books , music , magazines , or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages , they can cut the risk of being sued .
Libraries are meant to provide information anyways .
They have no need for things that are offensive , because rarely something that is offensive , provides information .
Libraries should just contain what they were made for : encyclopedias , dictionaries , books , and other books that can provide useful information to people .
In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age , should be taken out of libraries .
Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have
