Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today .
Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences .
However , many do not .
All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them .
If libraries accept offensive types of magazines , books , music , movies , etc.
, they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children .
Like many libraries in the city , there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults .
Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way .
Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong , a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate .
Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge .
By sticking to this method , offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them .
Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most .
There are still the majority , however , who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials .
Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but , from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong , people should be treated with dignity as well as respect .
No matter our color , size , looks , or personalities , we are all created equally as our constitution says .
Therefore , we should only view what would be considered just to all .
After all , everyone wishes to be treated kindly , right
