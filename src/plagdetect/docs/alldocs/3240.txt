what i think about all of this ?
Is that to me i really don't care because that is like who i am .
And its up the parents if they want the to remove the books off the shelf if they believe that a certain material as book , music , movies , and magazing should be remove off the shelves .
Also i dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone .
I mean its just a book it dose not really matter .
Next , i am saying this becuse i dont really would get offensive to stuff like this argument .
And also if there some stuff that kids shouldnt know about then they should put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy .
They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section .
Matter of fats i don't know why they should remove stuff like movie .
Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see they are really dumb to do that .
Beause there are moive that children can watch .
And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies , and other movie they were not to see at there ages .
Unless if their parents allowe it.And that goes with the same with the music .
I don't know if they have bad music in the library.I don't see rap stuff in the library.like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it.So this is my thought about this arguments
