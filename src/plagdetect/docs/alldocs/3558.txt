Do you think books , music , movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries ?
Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay .
I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves .
The reason is , is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't .
Also , some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things .
Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it , it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them .
Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it , so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others .
But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't .
People have different opinons about things , so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either .
Well , here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves .
I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it
