Now , one way or another that certain peice of material will be found and be used .
Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others .
So really , either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right ?
I don't suppose so , I would consider that unfair .
It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive , it does not mean that others @MONTH1 find that offensive in their opinion .
So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous .
For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an @CAPS1 for the author of that material .
Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers , readers , listeners , etc .
to look at and use , would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive .
It's big world out there , you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see , that no one will find a way , people will always find a way for it to get out or be found .
It would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing , listening , reading , etc .
Almost as if your in control of people , but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world .
Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do , and that what ever you find offensive @MONTH1 not , or actually does not mean everyone else does .
So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive .
Do not try to control what people or childeren should view , listen , or read becuase it will be found sooner or later .
No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect , reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everthing hidden
