In society today , people take things in very many different ways .
So things that might help one person , @MONTH1 offend other .
In libraries , there are different kinds of books ; fiction , non fiction .. ( etc ) .
So if you dont like a particular book , maybe you should try looking in a different area .
I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people .
We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1 , where we have freedom of speech .
So authors have freedom to write what they would like to .
They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people ?
I do not think that is right .
'
@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure . '
I think this quote goes along with this topic very well , because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else .
You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear .
Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change , and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic .
Now , this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people , but it @MONTH1 save a family , a friendship or maybe even a life .
Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance , her journal is now a book .
Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 , but her story has the right to be told .
Yes , there is violence in it , and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women , but the story has the right to be told , and should be told .
I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library , just because it has offened a few .
There are lots of different kinds of books , if the books you are reading offend you , look for a different type of book
