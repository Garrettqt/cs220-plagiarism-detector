What do you think about Books ?
Do you think it matters how appropriate they are ?
Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries .
I think that there are many different few from many different people on books .
Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period .
I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library .
I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have .
I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book .
I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it , parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read .
I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it .
Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library , or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it .
So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school .
They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books .
All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems
