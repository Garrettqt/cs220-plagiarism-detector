I belive that everyone has there own appioin on whats appropreate , and whats not .
You can't @CAPS4 taske a couple people and ask there oppinon because everyone is differant , we all have our owne rights to know books and what the aurthor realy wanted us to learn or here about .
Like i said everyone is differant if you @CAPS6't want your @CAPS1 to read it tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it to them .
@CAPS6't make the rest of the @CAPS1 suffer .
I belive some parents need to look at our ansatre there wernt even aloud to have dreams and thoughts .
Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go threw the same thing they had to , @CAPS1 @CAPS2 everyone shopuld have a right to look to read listen to what ever makes them happy , So what if i has volger launguage in it get over it or @CAPS6't listen to it all .
Would you want someone telling you that your life story for example was crummy and diddent like the way you worded things .
Thats the way you talk it's because it's your life story .
The way i see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also infor them of the good stuff in life so there won't allways be in fear .
Let the chinlden read what ever they want to read .
So what they curse tell your @CAPS1 that its bad launguage .
@CAPS6't get ride of good books movies music .
( @CAPS3 : ) @CAPS4 because the Author has a diff veiw on life than yours .
Open your @CAPS5 , @CAPS6't be so shallow
