Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies .
Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want .
Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however , are not intended for certain people , such as young children .
Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone .
Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life .
Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people , who would normally have access to a certain topic , to a general catigory .
Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else .
Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness .
Everyone finds something offensive .
Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter .
For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple .
Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range .
More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced .
Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading .
By not having censorship , everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like .
This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people
