I believe that if it has offensive language then it shouldn't be left of the shelf .
Also it really does matter if it has offensive language because you don't know who , where , when you child is going to learn offensive words .
Another thing he's going to say any offensive words .
Next one of the most important thing is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or any other bad thing you should watch what you say , what you do .
One reason why is because once he growing up he might follw you foot steps .
Another thing is that if the magazine , movie , book , etc.
, might have some raisem thing like jugging the person from where he/she come from , how they look , how they talk etc.
, can end up in a bad situation .
In conclusion what i 'm trying to say that it's both parents and book because the book your child has choosen might bad thing and the parents should watch them self on how they act
