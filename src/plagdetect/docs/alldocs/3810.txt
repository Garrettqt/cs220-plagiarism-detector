I think that libraries should not remove material such as book , music , movies , magazines .
I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading .
Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book , then i will go look at magazines , movies , music .
Thier are alot of movies out right now , and now u can go cheak them out .
Music is the same way .
I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it .
Im sure that they have edgucational books , movies and magazines .
If people take out stuff that kids and teens like .
Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too .
I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for .
The movies are easy to find .
and its quick .
If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie , music , magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public .
Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people .
The public would ` t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see , read , or listen .
That goes for movies , music , magazines , books and more .
I really hope the people make the right choice
