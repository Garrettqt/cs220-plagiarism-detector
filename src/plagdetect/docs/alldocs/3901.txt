Human beings , like snowflakes , are very much alike in a unique way .
Just as there are no two identical snowflakes , no two humans are exactly the same .
As everyone has their differences , there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity , and prefer to think outside the box .
However , it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge , if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study .
Therefore , if a person is mature enough , and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library , they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing , with permission of a gaurdian of course .
Unfortunately , it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority .
Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can , and can not read , but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read , and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner .
If one is legally eligable , and they have permission from their gaurdian , then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever .
Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1 ?
A person is never too young , or too old to learn something new , if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present !
It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day .
As well , it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology , and inventions that it is at today .
The youth of the present will one day be the engineers , doctors , scientists , and moving leaders of the future .
If these young people are curious , and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons , then let them be !
