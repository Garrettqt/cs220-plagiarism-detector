I believe that the children of today should be able to read , and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past .
Learning things through the same teachings , books , movies ... etc .
Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing , swaring and certain detailed writing , because if you took all that away its like lieing about history , and what really happend .
Should the children of today be deprived of the truth ?
Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive ?
Think about it ...
Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school ?
I didn't think so , so why start now ?
Say your child is going to be reading ' @ORGANIZATION1 ' in @CAPS1 class today .
Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the ' @CAPS2 ' word and the word 'slave ' out of the book ?
Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners , slaves , and racial comments ?
Depriving them of actual history ?
Would you also deprive them from learning about wars , revolutions , and mass killings just to make learning apropriate ?
No .
I wouldn't .
I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history .
I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
