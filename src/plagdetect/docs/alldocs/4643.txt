I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries .
Some people think books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, are offensive .
Those things might be offensive to them , but not to other people .
So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view .
I think they should not remove these things from the shelves .
Everyone has a different point of view like my mom for instence she likes vampire books and movies , but i like tragedy .
See everyone likes something different .
They also have to think to the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 , @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2 , etc.
, are offensive to some people .
Are we going to take those books out to .
I mean if we took books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, out for being offensive then we would not have any books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
Everyone thinks something offensive , some might think the same thing is offensive some might thing something different is offenseive .
We should not take books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, off the shevles .
I understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them .
It part of life though .
You can not take everything out to please one person , because it could make another person mad
