I believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world .
I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what .
My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read .
When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans .
If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced .
But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff .
their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them .
movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library .
if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in .
Music is passion to most people .
most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that .
their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about , either that or listen to the song over and over again .
My point is if something comes off the shelf is should return to its rightful spot or otherwise their will be consequences and people will not be trusted much longer
