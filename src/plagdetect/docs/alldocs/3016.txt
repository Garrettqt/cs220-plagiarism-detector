One essential right that every man , woman , or child should have is the freedom of speech .
Without this right no one would be able to express their views .
When libraries pull books , magazines , movies , and music off of their shelves it takes away that right .
Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people , the books or other items should be left on the shelves .
What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous .
If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book .
Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it .
I do think however , that books should be placed in the secton that they belong .
Sections for childrens books , young adult books , adult books , and many more can all be found in a library .
An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section .
beyond this , the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader .
If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1 , then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out .
The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves .
Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book .
The choice of what material you read should be left up to you , not restricted by what someone else finds offensive .
Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs .
The person should just not read the book .
Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore , there should not be censorship in libraries
