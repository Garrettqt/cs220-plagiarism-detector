Do I believe that ceertain materials , such as books , music , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
NO , the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me , they might not be offensive to other people .
Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not .
I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them .
That excites me .
Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don ' @CAPS1 need to pick it up !
If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up .
I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn ' @CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them ' .
Well thats a gud question .
Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn ' @CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way .
They were just writing a book .
It's not the writers fault .
He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book .
When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive .
DON ' @CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's .
So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad beacause they took it offensive .
Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book .
So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's .
Thanks for the conversation .
See you next
