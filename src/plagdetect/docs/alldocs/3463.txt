I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive .
People find different things offensive that others do not .
If you started takeing these things out , thers a good possibility that you 'll loose everything , books and your people .
One example I say this is because , some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them .
Others like the violence in those shows .
The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like .
Another example is , magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing .
That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school .
Kids might need the material that is offensive , it could help them through life .
In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive .
Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education .
Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching .
Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will .
