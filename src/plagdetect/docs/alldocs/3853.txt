Censorship @CAPS1 was the last time someone told you what you could , and couldn't do ?
Especially if it was somthing you didn't want to do .
How 'd that make you feel ?
You probably didn't want to do it did you .
Censorship is somewhat the same way .
The other day , my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out .
We weren't aloud to see it though .
You know why ?
Due to censorship , we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie .
So , now the only way we 'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us .
Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends ?
Doesn't go so well does it .
Censorship violates freedom of being different .
You can't listen to music , watch movies , or even read certain books , unless your of a certain age .
That's not fair .
Censorship is like a modern day @CAPS2 .
Tells you what you can and can't do , how you can dress , and what to say .
Everybody would be the same then .
How did @CAPS2 do with his idea , he failed miserably .
How do you think the @CAPS4 victims felt , they were punished for believing , or doing something different .
They weren't hurting anybody , they just wanted to live they 're lives a diffent way .
Thats what censorships doing , classifying people in to certain groups .
telling them what they can and can't see , do , or listen to .
Thats what makes the world different , people that are different .
Dont't make everyone be the same .
