In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book , movies , music , and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us , but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up .
So i think that those things ( books , music , movies , magazines ) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it .
Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called ' @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 ' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them , also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves , and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you , they will take out advantage of it , how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes , but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them ... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all
