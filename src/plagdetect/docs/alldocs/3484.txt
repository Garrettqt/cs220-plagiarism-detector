I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books , music , movies and magazines .
Some of the books people need to know about .
Take the consentration camps for instince , people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again .
I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed .
So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger .
They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent .
Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human .
So keeping them in shelves could help our future .
Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn .
My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever .
In conclution , we should keep some of these bad books , music , movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again
