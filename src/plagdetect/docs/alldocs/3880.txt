Dear Newspaper : @CAPS1 , there should be censorship in libraries , but people should be a certain age just to check the book out .
Some people go to the libraries just for censorship .
These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book .
Plus , if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't .
Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem .
However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people .
I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries , but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good .
That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies .
I 'm finish but I will leave you with this question : do you really want to take censorship out the libraries ?
