Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment , for their enjoyment , to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons .
Reading should not be restricted by any means .
If a person has an interest in a book , they should be able to read it if they so choose .
I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done .
For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice , is mind boggling .
I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home .
If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community .
It's not fair to everyone else .
If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive , there are many other alternative books to read .
Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like , that is why there are many sections in a library .
The sections in a library range from mystery to romance , so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them .
That way you are happy and so is everyone else .
Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books .
Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it .
If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read .
Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to .
Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words , scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it .
If you have a problem with it , don't read it .
It's that simple .
Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion .
