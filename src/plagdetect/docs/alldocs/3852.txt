A library is a public place for all ages .
They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons .
For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it .
For adults they have coffe tables , sofa seats , and many different things while they read their books .
never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out .
Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive .
I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for , they should also be monitored while in the library .
Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way .
The library is a public place and is made for all ages , even though there are book stores that sell just adult books , movies , and magazines , they still shouldn't throw them out of a library .
There should be equal rights all over , yes even in libraries .
The world is full of offensive things period .
Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library .
The removal of certain books , movies , and magazines wouldn't really stop anything .
I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books , movies , and magazines .
If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books .
I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing .
This subject really doesn't bother me , so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library .
