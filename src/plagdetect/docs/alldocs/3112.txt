Libraries should never remove any material just because it @MONTH1 be found offensive .
Something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another .
If the material was so offensive that it went against the law , then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place .
People often get offended if they read , see , or listen to something that goes against their personal views , ethics , or religion .
But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values .
Though peoples ' opinions differ , each opinion is equally important to that certain person .
So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions .
As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored .
I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to .
But if I am looking for something maybe more religious , derogoratory , or less accepted , it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things .
In closing , if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read , watch , or listen to it .
But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them
