What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library .
If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public .
Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature , this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone .
I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone .
Currently , some people arent happy with some of the books , music , movies , and magazines that are available at many libraries .
They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers .
Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children .
While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries ; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries .
By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public .
If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover , then the parents have noone to blame but themselves .
I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card .
This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as : swearing in books and music , nudity in movies and magazines .
This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card .
If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list , the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book .
I can see how censorship is very useful and important .
Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme .
There is a solution out there , but we just need to find it .
