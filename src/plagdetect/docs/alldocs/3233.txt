Censorship In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from .
Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones .
It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read .
Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available .
If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it .
I believe that if books , magazines , movies , etc .
were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people .
Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money .
If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also , and other libraries won't buy it .
Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people .
Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn .
Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored .
If a book is removed from the library for its contents , people will look into as to why it was removed .
It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive .
The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also .
Since censorship is probably mostly opinion , there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't .
With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people .
If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on , this might mean we need new publishers , or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world .
The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group .
When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question .
Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library
