In my opinion , I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves .
These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people , but it can be to others .
They can be against some peoples religion and way of life .
I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf .
Now they are putting those same books in libraries .
These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them .
Are these books you want your children to be reading ?
There are even movies that are like those books .
Many shows are based of a book series , and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one .
The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers .
The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that .
They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing .
They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in .
I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all .
In my opinion , the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them .
After that , the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them .
There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not .
What do you think ?
Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way ?
Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good ?
Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do ?
