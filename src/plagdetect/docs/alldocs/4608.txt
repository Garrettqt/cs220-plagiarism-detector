Librarys are filled with hundreds of materials that many @CAPS4 like and dislike .
Books on @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 , @CAPS2 .
Those books are @CAPS3 there to offend you they 're there to educate you on the subject .
Censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything .
You make your own desicons and live by them .
If you feel like a book , a song , a movie , is offensive , then stop reading , listening , or watching .
@CAPS3 everyone gets offended .
I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the @NUM1- @CAPS3 every one is @NUM2- @CAPS4 have diffrent @CAPS2 and outlooks on @NUM3- @CAPS5 the @CAPS6 .
I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced , but shouldnt be to a great extent , @CAPS7 us do what we do , and learn what we learn .
In school were forsed to learn what we learn , i believe @CAPS5 right to have out side knowledge , but only way that is that we get it from data bases such as computers , books , music , art , etc
