In life you have the 'offensive things ' .
The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us .
No it is not easy to get over , but these things will make you stronger .
Sometimes there are books , magazines , music and movies that offened us .
The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality , or our life .
It's not the authors fault , they write what they feel and what is the truth .
Okay , so libraris are full of book's , movies , music , etc .
You can't just take books off the shelves , just because they offened you .
Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate .
There are more books in the library you can read .
Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library ; it will hurt whoevers ' company got the book published and also the writters .
Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells ' there books , magazines , movies .
They make thousands of copies of thier product , which takes money .
So to make thier money back , they sell to thousands of book stores .
Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's .
Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world .
Books , newspapers tell the truth about a subject .
Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you .
Why cant the world be more open ?
I know in my own life i have read books that at first , the book offended me .
I would get so mad , i would put the book down and walk away .
But then , my eyes would open and finaly it hit me .
The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding .
The views i used to have would be gone .
It is strange how you finnaly open up , and your life changes .
Some people might even find this paper offensive .
But if nobody is stepping on your toes , and getting under your skin you wont ever change .
Offened is a word used lightly ; yes , people use it a lot but do they really mean it .
Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me ' .
Stop being about yourselves and get over it .
Life is to short to worry and feel offended .
Every single book , magazine , movie and music needs to be left alone .
Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers ' .
Just read another book , or watch a different move .
Please do not remove anything from the selves , because it will only do more damage
