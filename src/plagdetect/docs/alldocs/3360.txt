Libraies should not be able to remove books , movies , and magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended .
If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies , magizines , and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies , and magizines would not return to the library any more .
For example , I like to listen to hard rock , heavy metal , and rap .
But , the people that go to church just like to listen to church music .
If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it .
This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them .
Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie , that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book , magizine , or movie .
Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines .
If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned .
This permission slip will and can be used for all movies .
Libraries should not remove their books , magizines , or movies .
They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out .
So , library material should be a choice
