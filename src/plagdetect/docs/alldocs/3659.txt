Censorship in the libraries .
Do you think that we should be able to take movies , magizens , and books off the shelf .
There are many different arguments about this subject .
I believe if they put the books , movies , and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others .
They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world .
because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older .
I think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it .
Some people @MONTH1 say that we are two young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better of you will be when you get older .
So that is my input on the situation .
the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff
