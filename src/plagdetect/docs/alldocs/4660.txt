We have all been to a library at some point in our life .
Have you ever been looking around and seen something that @MONTH1 have been offensive , or something you didnt agree with ?
What if you had the chance to have if takin off the shelves for good ?
Or , what if someone else had the choice to ?
Would you allow them to do so ?
In my opinion , I would say no .
Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves , just because it @MONTH1 be offensive to them , or there way of life .
I say , if you do not like it , do not look at it , it is simple as that .
For example , what if you were into rap , or the hip hop culture , and someone finds that offensive ?
Would you give them the right to keep it from you ?
Or , would you really want to do that to someone else ?
Lets say you are a christian , and an atheist finds the @CAPS1 offence , or untruthfull , so he has it takin off the shelves .
Does that sound fair to you ?
If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture , or finds it offensive , all they would have to do , is simply stay away from it .
The point is , if we all were to take something off the shelves , there would adventually be nothing left .
Respect what other cultures and ways of life do , and stay away from what offends you .
Would you like someone to have what you like takin off the shelves ?
I would not , so you should not do that to other people .
