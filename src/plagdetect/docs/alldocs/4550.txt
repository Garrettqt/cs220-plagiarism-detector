Alot of things can be found offensive now days , but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it .
Everyone has their own view , and opinon on things .
For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it .
No , I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves .
Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy .
Its simple , if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries .
Yes , there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive , but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy .
I have been to many libraries in my life .
I have not really seen anything offensive , but I have seen some books and movies for adults only .
Honestly in my eyes its simple , if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it , because others @MONTH1 enjoy it .
Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves .
Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it .
You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions .
