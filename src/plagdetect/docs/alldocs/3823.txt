I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they 're found offensive to people .
If someone reads something and it offends them , they can go do something else .
I 'm not the type of person to get offended too easily , So I don't know how well my opinion fits .
Everyone gets offended over something , so I can see why people find somethings offensive .
But in all honesty , if someone read something and thought that it was offensive , they have the option to either say why they thought it was offensive , or they could just ignore it .
In libraries , I think that if the @CAPS1 finds a story offensive , it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves , They work there after all .
If it were me though , I 'd just let it go , and if someone asks me to remove it , I might do it .
Alot of people now-a-days , seem to take offense over everything .
But a material should not be removed from a library shelve , unless the @CAPS1 , or the manager , find it offensive , then I can understand their decision .
