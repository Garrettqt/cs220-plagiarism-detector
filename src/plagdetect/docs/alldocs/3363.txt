They need to remove the bookstors because all studeds wants that the library have many books like spanish books or the diffrent culture , and the students can knows diffrent languges or that they can do many this with that books .
Like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words .
And also the music and movies they need to remove because some dvds are spokeds thats they need to remove .
For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took , and the people can takes the book without pay nothing , thats the people want that the librarys are free .
Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds , magazines , etc .
Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world ....
I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too ... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place , like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place .
would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea .
And the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read .
