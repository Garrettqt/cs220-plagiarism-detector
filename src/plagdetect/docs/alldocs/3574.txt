Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2 The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country .
In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland .
In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech .
If we censor materials like books , music , movies , etc .
it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1 .
Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes .
Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject , thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything .
If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn ?
There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation .
When you censor 'bad things ' it creates naive thinkers , which only leads to discrimination .
I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive .
For example , movies have ratings for different age groups , and books could do the same .
Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary .
I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I 've seen on television .
Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart ' education but that is good .
Today we live in a scary and violent society , so being 'street smart ' is an advantage .
If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before .
If books , movies , magazines , music , etc .
are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom .
