Books are to be read not taken off beacuse of what they say .
That to me is stupid are childern live in world of war and fear everyday what is a damn book gon na change ?
Nothing there gon na hear the f word and see blood and gore .
Would you rarther them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do .
Music is one thing that can bring everybody together .
So by are childern not being able to hear some of them lyrics then we are pushing them into being pussys .
Maybe there just some real people teelling the truth that you dont want your kid to hear .
Movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay @MONEY1 to get onto see them sometimes .
Are kids are gon na be better because there parnets didnt want them to see the new horror movie there gon na see in real life one day why not now ?
Parnets your not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world YOUR @CAPS1 US @CAPS2 because when we get into that sitituation in real life we arent gon na know what to do then were scewed .
