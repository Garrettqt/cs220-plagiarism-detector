You are not elgible to check out this book ' , says the libranian .
You are just too young for this book .
To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed .
The common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please .
The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read .
Books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, are all under censorship .
Everyonee takes things in differently , being said some are mature than others .
If they want to play that game , or read that book they should be allowed .
The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material .
Therefore they are held accountable for their actions .
Isnt that how legal laws are carried out ?
If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves .
Something @MONTH1 seem offensive to one person but someone else @MONTH1 find that interesting .
For example , when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @MONTH1 say things tha offends his ?
her fans .
They people who are not fans of him/her @MONTH1 find it ammusing ; so they should remove the post because some people dont like it .
Someone @MONTH1 like that book , music , movie , or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people .
Interest @MONTH1 vary , but a teen @MONTH1 like the same type of books as an adult .
Censorship laws wont let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age , and to me that is unfair .
It is a new day and age ; things have changed from what they once were .
Cencorship laws should be wiped out completly .
If you @MONTH1 find a book offensive in any way , shape , or form just dont read it .
Nobody is forcing to read that specific book ; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books .
There is a book out there that you will enjoy .
In conclusion , certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive .
Some other peoople @MONTH1 like that same aterial .
There shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all .
That is just unfair , and unjust to some people .
Its a new time and age and things are different .
People of any age should be able to check out any book they please
