I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelfs .
Books , magazines , and the rest of the materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and their observations .
With the population of readers in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I no that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a hole .
The world needs its materials .
The writer of the book writes on his Observations and his own personal experiences in life .
The @CAPS3 put so much into it why take it away cause someone doesn't like how part of it's worded .
Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where theres a little blood .
Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing .
I seriously think some parents think if their kid here a bad work or sees a little podle of blood that the kid is going to end up in jail .
Then there is music .
The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop .
I agree with that , but I also don't see if its christain rap or its a clean song whats wrong with it .
A musician is not just payed for his or her amazing skills with an instrument , but also with his or her way to connect with the listener .
I truely don't see any reason for take any form of materials off the shelfs .
The artist who produces it has a right to their own oppion .
The public I feel makes a big deal out of nothing .
The smallest problems don't name the material the way the reader hears the work of the artist
