What is offensive ?
How do we know what offends people , I mean everyone is different , everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs .
So how are we suppose to know what offends who ?
The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination , gender discrimination , or religious discrimination .
Those types of things would offend most people I think , but you can never be to sure .
Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish , because everyone has the right to freedom of speech .
People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want .
People need to come to sence and understand that consept .
If a book , magazine , song , movie , or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read , listen to , or watch that item .
No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them .
People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases .
Books , songs , movies , magazines , and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in , but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe ?
So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record , it is their life let them live it .
