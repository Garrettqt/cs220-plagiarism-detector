There a books , music , movies , magazines , and etc .
that are not appropriate for children .
Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question , if children shouldnt read , watch , or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont .
I dont think they should take those kind of books , movies , or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also .
There just gon na take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens .
That doesnt make any sence at all .
I think either the child should know what he or she can read , watch , or listen too , and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose .
A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books , music , or movies from ones that are appropriate for children .
That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness .
