Should libraries remove offensive reading material ?
No , I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just @CAPS4 some people find @CAPS5 offensive .
There's offensive material everywhere .
Just because you find @CAPS5 offensive doesn't mean someone else does .
In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at @CAPS5 or read @CAPS5 .
A few months ago I was at the library .
I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write .
I over heard two girls talking .
They were arguing about something .
I moved closer to them so I could hear .
'
@CAPS1's this one about ? '
The girl asked .
'That's a really good book !
@CAPS5's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives .
@CAPS5 goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies , and about his love life after @CAPS6's gone . '
The other girl said .
'So you 're saying @CAPS5's about sex ? '
The first girl asked .
'
@CAPS2 , but only slightly . '
The other girl answered .
'
I 'm not going to read this ! '
The first girl said .
'
@CAPS3 why not ? '
The second girl asked , confused .
'
@CAPS4 @CAPS5 talks about sex !
Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this . '
The first girl answered , ' @CAPS5 sends the wrong message . '
@CAPS6 added .
After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about .
I started reading @CAPS5 .
Intresting .
Actually , @CAPS5 was a very good book .
The second girl was right .
@CAPS5 wasn't mainly about sex .
@CAPS5 was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and @CAPS1 the man went through after his love died .
That got me thinking .
Should certain reading material be removed because @CAPS5 talks about sex , drugs , murders , ect or @CAPS4 someone finds @CAPS5 offensive ?
No , @CAPS5 shouldn't .
There's offensive material in real life and @CAPS5's not being removed .
Why should @CAPS5 be removed from a library ?
@CAPS1's @CAPS5 matter if @CAPS5's in a book ?
There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone .
That's just how life is .
