Coming from a teenager , @CAPS1 offensive books , magazines and movies should be removed from a local library .
A library is a place to go relax and read .
Most books and movies are filled with sex , gang violence , and drugs .
In my generation sex , durgs and , gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere .
Books are suppose to be about learning .
Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries .
Sex , gang violence , and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation .
Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics , but they all deal with either sex , drugs , or violence .
Children should never be exposed to that type of offensive behavor .
You should be able to open a magazine and learn somthing brand new .
Books are good for reseach paper and other school project , but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics .
Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with the topic you dont want .
As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence .
If younger children , countiued to read about bad topics , it will create a bad habit on that child .
They say you are involved with what you read .
Bad habit could lead to many things , such as killing , smoking , and pregnacy's .
Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children .
Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books , movies , and magazine in a local library .
Offensive books and movies can cause many problems .
It drive children where they sont need to be , and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit .
there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library .
