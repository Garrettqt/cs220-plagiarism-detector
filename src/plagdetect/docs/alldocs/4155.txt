I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to .
I read world war @CAPS1 books , and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read .
If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it .
I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1 , and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things , because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder .
I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad .
Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them , so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway .
I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines .
