This is going to be an essay about if people finding somthing offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored .
It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offinsive .
The way I look or my own oppinion is that they should censore most things from libraries and music , but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive .
If you think about it thoses uncensered material like books that some people fnd offinsive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up .
On the other hand they should be more carful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they dont get the wrong ideas .
We should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it .
In the long run it might help with a more clean and safe population because were are censoring things to wear people dont hear bad and only hear the good in life .
You never know you could make a big differance by doing that .
The reason i wouldnt go out and censor everthing is because you cant stop everone from doing it .
You can always give it a try but thats one of the main reasons why i wouldnt try and get rid of it cause a sertan person might find it offensive .
I ncan understand if you took it off there self that someone found offinse but only move it to wear no one will find it offensive .
Im not saying its wrong to do that but i think it could and probably would make alot of people angry .
But hey what can i say what has the government done that we dont like or cant do anything about it .
And thats all i have to say about that .
