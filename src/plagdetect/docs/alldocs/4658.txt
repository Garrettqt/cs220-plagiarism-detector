Hello @ORGANIZATION1 , I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries .
In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive .
i have a broad view on this subject .
My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library , the should censor tv .
I have deaf parents , so we always have the captions on in our house .
Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored .
I also have seen images that are not censored .
The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library .
So why not censor tv .
I see things on tv that i wont see in a library .
In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out .
There are plenty of other places that are worse .
Like crimes scenes , cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language .
These are my views ancd yours could be differnt .
