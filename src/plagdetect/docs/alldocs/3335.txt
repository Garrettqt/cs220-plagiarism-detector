I think books , movies , music , and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs .
If you find something offensive then dont pick it up , its that simple .
You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else .
It is all according to you own personal opinion .
Sure , there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people , and those people will try to put a stop to it .
But I think that is wrong .
Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf .
Then it disrupts that persons study .
I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material , all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek .
It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way .
There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people .
And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch .
In my conclusion , I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs .
It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people .
But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic .
For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights
