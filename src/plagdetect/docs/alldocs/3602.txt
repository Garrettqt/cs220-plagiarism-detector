I believe there should not be censorship in libraries , because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually .
The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose .
The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read .
Then the third is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose .
The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book .
Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship .
The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says .
