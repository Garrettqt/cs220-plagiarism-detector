Yes , I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in .
Materials like that can offend many people , so they should be removed from public shelves .
For example , someone , by accident , @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials .
They could take it home and begin reading it , and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them .
That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book , and they could begin losing customers .
Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is , children .
What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library , and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it ?
That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see .
But , it does happen .
Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be .
They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach .
Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also , even some adults do not even prefer it .
Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves .
It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials .
And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it , they would be greatly offended and very upset .
That could turn many people away from reading certain books , or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials .
In conclusion , all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended .
This is why materials such as books , magazines , etc .
should be removed from public shelves , because they can offend many people
