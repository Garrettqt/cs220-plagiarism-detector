I think if its offensive it should not be avavible for kids intill they are old enough to read it , listen to it .
I think they need to be removed from shelves or put away .
Because it can be hurtful , dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves .
I belive the magazines can be put away or put into its own sections .
Music or movies could be put in there own sections also .
Internet could be blocked for certain websites .
Luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults .
And people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff .
This is what I think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves .
If they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not .
