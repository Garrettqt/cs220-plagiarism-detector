Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction , nonfiction , historical , fantasy , and adventure .
These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf .
One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2 ' .
This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country .
Why , because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people .
A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4 .
This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow ' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4 ? '
.
Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart .
But , people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real .
But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs .
The book ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs .
So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race , sex , or group ; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive .
Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1 ' !
