Dear editor , I feel that we should not take any movies , books , and music off the self .
I mean realy it will start confliced.Then we have law suight .
I have seen what happens when you take a book off the self .
the people start yelling because they did not find it offending .
Then they say that they are going to suw .
Last it costs mouney to go to corght .
I have also seen what happens when u take music off the self .
people yell at first .
Then they start to get vilent .
Know you have a mob of people destoyinh your store because you took down some music .
This is why we need to keep them all up .
You can take this any way that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late .
I hope that you will put this in the peaper thank you .
Sinserily Your , @PERSON1
