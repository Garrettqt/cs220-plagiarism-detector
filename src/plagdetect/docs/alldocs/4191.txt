I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs .
Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it .
Censorship is kind of out of the way .
I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life .
If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice .
I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything .
But this is what I think is right
