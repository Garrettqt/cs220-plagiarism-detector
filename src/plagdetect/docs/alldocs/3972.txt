Libraries are full of all different sorts of books , movies and magazines .
These books , movies , and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people .
Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies .
Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf ?
If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf , there would be nothing left in the library .
Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need .
Young Children need books to help their imagination grow .
If there was not anymore books in the library , children would not be able to learn or grow .
Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book .
If the book or movie is found offensive to you , pick another , but it should not be removed from the shelf .
One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you , but @MONTH1 not to another person .
A world without books .
No imagination .
No adventures .
It would be a boring world .
I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all .
That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes
