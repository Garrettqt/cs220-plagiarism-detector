Should books , music , movies , and magazines that are offensive to public be removed ?
No , I strongly disagree .
Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more .
All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them .
For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out .
In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason .
No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys .
Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex .
Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case .
Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self .
People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others .
In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion .
You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem .
For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you .
