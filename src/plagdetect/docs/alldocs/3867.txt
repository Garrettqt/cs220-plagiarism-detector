In a library , should certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear .
Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people .
The words in songs can be offensive .
Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners .
Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex , race , and violence .
I believe that , if a book , music , movies , or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular .
If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways ; and if you 're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you .
I have been in a library a few times in my life .
When I search for what im looking for , I ignore what offends me or upsets me .
In a library , should certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
My answer is no , for the reasons I have listed above .
People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them
