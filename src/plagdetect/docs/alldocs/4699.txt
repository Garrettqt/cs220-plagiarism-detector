Have it ever occured to you that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not for young children ?
Certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people .
Not all books , music , movies , and magazines offend people or condone in things but they also give children the right to learn about things or know things that are to rated and shouldnt be learned at a library .
Most music in todays society is not appropiate because of the content that is used such as sex , drugs , and violence .
last fall when I visited my shools library I came across a movie that I thought was not school appropiate and should'nt be seen without a parents verification .
Anything about sex and drugs give young teens and children the right away to do it even if they read it , heard it , or saw it in school .
when im walking through the town and I see teens doing things that should'nt be done the first thing the first thing he/or she says is ' I heard it on a movie ' .
Most public lbraries have movies , book , music , and etc on shelves that aren't appropiate but it should'nt be welcomed to young children .
most librians are busy and cant watch the entire library , but can make sure it is secured and put away from juveniles .
Most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun .
Todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it .
In a school library @PERCENT1 of the time all books are age appropiate , but in a public library it's not because the public library is not just for children but for adults too .
some books shouldnt be of shelves but the rated things should be .
In conclusion libraries need to watch what's being checked out no matter who its from and I.d should be asked for .
