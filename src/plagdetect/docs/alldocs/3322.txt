Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1 , Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read ?
No , I do not think they should be removed .
I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age .
Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section .
The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self .
Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section .
Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too .
It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read .
For example , if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy , it 'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults .
So yes , the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it .
But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project .
Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager .
That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate .
Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age .
It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection
