I don't think that certain materials in books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say , but I do think some things in books , movies , and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student .
Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students , it would just depend on what they are reading , watching , and hearing .
I 've never experienced anything offensive in what i 've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i 've heard .
I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad .
It's mostly in rap music that i 've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written .
But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say
