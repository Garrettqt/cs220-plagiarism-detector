Do I believe certain material , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive ?
No , just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves .
Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people .
Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf .
Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books .
If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empy book stores .
Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe , like religion , is being made fun of in a book that they had read about .
We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different .
We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine .
We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different , more positive , or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf .
You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was benefitial or relating .
So it should not be up to one person , but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option
