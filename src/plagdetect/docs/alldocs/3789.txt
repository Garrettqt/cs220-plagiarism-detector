They will see it eventually .
There is no reason to censor a library , I believe .
I think they should be sectioned off , maybe put the 'offensive ' books in the back of the libarary is enough censorship .
You have to look at it in the publishers view also .
They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so .
Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive .
We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1 .
Things that show innaproperate pictures , drugs , firearms .. ect .
I believe they are already censored enough .
Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive ' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds .
Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading .
If you decide to write and publish a book , don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it ?
I do , there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to .
The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive .
That's not fair in @LOCATION1 .
I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials .
offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
