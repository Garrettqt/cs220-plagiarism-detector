Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people .
I feel very strongly about my statement , because everyone in this world is different .
Many people have different interests , religons , and customs .
If we took out certain books , and music from the library , it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library .
But if we had different sections of books , music , etc.
, people would be able to find what they want/need more easily , and no one would have to worry about getting offended .
It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended .
