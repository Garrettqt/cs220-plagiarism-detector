All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf.Well at least I know I have a book like that , its called ' @CAPS1 ' .
I , myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex .
A while back when I was in the seventh grade , I read this book called , ' @CAPS1 ' .
I was a good book but it was also very explesive .
The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship , peer pressure , and a adiction to sex and drug .
This book was exposing and very detailed , In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book .
I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media .
Inconclusion , I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive .
Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older
