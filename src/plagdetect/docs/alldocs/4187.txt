CENSORSHIP @CAPS1 : @CAPS2 paper Do I believe the certain materials , such a book , music , movies , magazines , ect.
, should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.my opinion is the if some one wants to write a magazines or a book is okay because the are giveing there opinion know some people just have to say what they believe and some to fight for what they want not just censorship has there fight every one has one .
Some materials like music , movies and magazines need to be censor because the kids how go to the libraries kids who are like @NUM1 @NUM2 grade or maybe smaller then that .
We need to clean the libraries from thigs the kids are not old enough to see or to hear.Libraries are a place to study and to read a good book or maybe a magazine we have to censor the bad languge and the bad pictures .
This can be very offensive for some parents beacuse the @MONTH1 talk about the color of another person or a bad language to offen the goverment .
People don't have the actittud to stop with this bad songs how contain censorship see somepeople who write this they say the peolpe don't have the actittud to be or say what they want , i think the we need people like that to just point fingers and say thats the bad guy but enswer this what good have you done to clean the libraies .
Censorship is just a small fight about removeding bad contains from the shelves this is just a call make your city a good place to live help the libraries help today change you future tomorrow make a differens
