Libraries have always had interesting materials , such as , books , music , movies , and magazines , and there always will be .
Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials .
I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting ?
Thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books .
If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books .
If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out .
Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them , its your choice to read that book , nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable .
Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library , then the library could decide whether they want to or not , but they still dont need to be told what to do .
Its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go .
If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself .
I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book .
Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are .
Thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life .
