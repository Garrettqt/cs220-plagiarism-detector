In many libraries there are books , movies , magazines and much much more .
Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages .
I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read .
It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads .
Let us start with books .
There are many different types of books .
From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires .
How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though ?
The answer is simple .
When you are younger , your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature , you begin to make thoses choices yourself .
It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book .
Movies guidelines are along the same pattern .
Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth .
When you grow up , you learn to read about the movie , and look at the rating .
If it seems to intimadating , or innapropiate , or violent , you make the choice to see it or not .
Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books .
If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian .
Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation .
Some suggestions could be : to remove the item from the shelf , or to write and extra review on the book , or write to the author/movie director .
The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone .
If it offends you , just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out .
Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't .
There are many books , movies , magazines , etc .
out in the world .
Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive .
There are many other choices that are 'okay ' .
So if you don't approve of a certain book , just send it back to the library and find one you do like .
