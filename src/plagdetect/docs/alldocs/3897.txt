I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book .
What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive .
I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves .
For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive .
In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at .
Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten .
Another example would be slavery .
I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with .
In the reality it was a hard time for the africans .
I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive .
How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation .
If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible .
Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven , but a lot of other people do believe in it .
So how would that work out in the long run ?
it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well .
In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them , but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me , but it will only be a problematic subject in the future .
