When i go to the library , most of the time , I 'm doing research on a specific topic .
The information I want , is the facts that really happened , or took place .
This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody .
Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we 're reading , or researching .
It is important for readers and researches , to connect and take in all the information they read .
That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing .
Authors write the things they write , for a reason .
Taking there hard work off the shelves , because some little thing offends someone , is not fair to them .
Besides , either way , someone is getting offended , because the auther is goin to get offended , for taking his hard work off the shelves .
As you @MONTH1 tell , i am against censoring our libraries .
The way i see it , is that if something offends you , then dont look at it
