Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear .
Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing , it is sometimes over-used .
Not everyone has the same views and morals , what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions .
In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive , instead of demanding it be removed or censored , simply do not watch , or read it etc .
Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience .
No one is forceing people to read or watch things , that is why there is something called viewers disgression .
If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1 .
In @LOCATION1 , we have freedom of speech , the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose .
To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant .
For example the censorship of useing the word ' @CAPS1 ' in vain on television .
I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs .
Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs .
Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical , instead of demanding it be removed , I simply don't watch it .
I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things , like nudity on television .
Although if something is censored simply because of a belief , or moral , or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it , that is blowing censorship out of proportion .
If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it .
