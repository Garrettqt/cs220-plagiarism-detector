I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive .
But some of those books have a meaning behind it .
I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read , and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .
The book uses the ' @CAPS3 ' word alot and many people take that offensive , but why ?
There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 .
From my perspective I think it should stay the same .
Why change that now ?
Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1 .
Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days .
The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life .
Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word , but also not change it now , after its been out for along time to the public .
The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is being changed
