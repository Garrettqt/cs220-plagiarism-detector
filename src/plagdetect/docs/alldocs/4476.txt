I feel that a person has the right to go to a liberay and get a book , magazine , moive , and whatever else they might because someone could use the material for infomatin they @MONTH1 need .
I however do feel that is should be handled maturly , @CAPS1 kept in a special area or somewhere a child or person that should not have material about anything unuseful to them .
I think if it is something for an adult only them there sould be no way of a child getting ahold of it .
A person does have a right i feel to go to the libery and get whatever book they @MONTH1 need for personal infomation to help themself to for resherch paper they need infomation on .
Anyting inapporatie should have it's own spot away from anyting else .
As i have mentioned I do feel that there should be some protection for childern number one , who do not to be reading about something over there head , and two for someone who doesn't really need that infomation to help them get infomation about someting .
I think there is many things that can help prevent someone form feeling like the libery need censorship number one would be have a special room just for things that are deemed inapportiate to someone which leads me to my next point there should be a worker just for determing in something should be kept in a specail room .
I think there defanilty should be a certian age to enter a room for uncensored materials .
If they do not meet the requirments dont let them in .
I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons .
As i have menioned I do feel that everyting should be allowed because is could be needed by someone for person infomation , or a classroom prompt that needs infomation .
But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirments as to what is apportiate and what is not .
If that person has a legitament reason for needed something i don't see the harm of them getting what they need
