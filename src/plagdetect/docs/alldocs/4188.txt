I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive .
I think children should only be able to read certain books cause , some books say things should know until they get older.Some books , music , movies , magazines should be removed if offensive .
I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books , music like that for little kids .
They put to many things they should not in kids movies .
The movie the @CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of bad language in it .
It is about these guys who take ruphies .
This guy cheats on his girlfriend , and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie .
they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things .
I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch .
Some music has to much bad language in it .
I think they should make better songs for kids .
Songs that really mean something or about someone .
Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors .
Like @PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad , and she should not be doing .
I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it .
I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves .
I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them .
If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it .
So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but , it is not .
