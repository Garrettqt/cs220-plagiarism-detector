Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book , @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it .
If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was good music , book , or magazie .
I would get it cause thats what children do explore .
books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me .
Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them .
Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book , @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh .
But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books .
But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world , and what it brings you .
The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past .
I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand .
So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3 , @CAPS4 , @CAPS5 , and @CAPS6 .
Thats not what sum parents want you to hear .
Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds .
Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind .
parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things .
But they feel that they knows whats best for u .
What ever they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already .
That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs .
But if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way .
