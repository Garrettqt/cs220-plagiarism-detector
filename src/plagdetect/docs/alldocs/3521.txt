If materials are offensive they should not be displayed .
Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age .
I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive , then they should be removed .
Materials at libraries are not for everyone .
A lot of it is especially not for young children .
For example : @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting to him/her .
The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them .
Once they watch the movie , it @MONTH1 have some heavy language , sex-related humor or content .
Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture .
Also if they have nervous parents , the library could get some calls .
Today , a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen , watched , or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it .
People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1 .
If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines , it would absolutely bother them .
If they won't take them off of the shelves , the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity , sex , and strong violence in them .
They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material .
With all of the nasty things that are seen in books , movies , magazines , etc.
, people need to be alerted to what they read and watch .
Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say .
Library materials must be checked .
If they are found offensive , and proved offensive , they should be moved .
