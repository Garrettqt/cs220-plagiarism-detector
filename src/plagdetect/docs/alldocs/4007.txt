Books now an days have action , romases , and , etc .
So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have .
So they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1 , The @CAPS2 side , The @CAPS3 , and all of the vampor books .
It's because they have action , love , and etc .
The books that are on and off the shelf .
Are maybe really good books .
Some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not .
Really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is .
Because the book is boring , or a old school book , they really don't have what the raeder is looking for .
However the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side .
That book has gotten sold faster than the movies .
The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because .
The books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side .
Is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie .
I heard that , that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie .
So their for poeple really like books that from a movie .
They are more reasons why poeple like books now and days .
You don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone , ipod , itouch , ipad and a nook , etc .
So now you dont have to go to a book store anymore .
You can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books .
They can however now just get them on the go .
So that is why books are now on the shelfs for good .
Because you can get it on the go .
But I believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book .
Should try and just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school
