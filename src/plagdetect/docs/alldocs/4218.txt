Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve .
People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something .
If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it .
The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away .
If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it .
I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it .
There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else .
So why get it removed from the shelve ?
I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but , if I did then I would not say anything .
Now some people would say something but , what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper , and it was not there because someone found it offensive ?
What would you do ?
Yes you could get on the internet but , it might not have what you are looking for exactly .
I have had a lot of research papers .
There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research .
I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up .
When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything .
I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late .
Computers are good for looking up stuff , but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information , you go for the book not the computer .
I know there are materials that are offensive to people .
I know people get mad at them but , it is not the librarys fault .
They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them .
So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it .
