To remove or not to remove Should people be able to remove books that are offensive ?
I think so ; it would help our kids and young adults , to read more educational books , rather than magazines and comics .
To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive , and whats not .
personally I don't think that we should remove books , because their offensive ; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books .
But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion .
Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore , and if to have them or not .
personally I like books with blood and gore ; because it shows how the world auccualy is .
It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress .
Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book .
I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them .
In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up , and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo
