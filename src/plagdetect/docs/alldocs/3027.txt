The libraries can contain book that are offensive to humans and animals .
The book the are very offensive can contain megative coments just to entertain the readers .
I believe that all book , music , magazines , and etc should be removed from the shelves if they are found to contain offensive and negative thing about any human .
For example , in political cartoon inside of newspapers , @PERSON1 is sometimes compared with a @CAPS1 .
We as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a @CAPS1 .
I take that very offensive because , back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing , the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys .
I being offened is not a good thing , and they last place they need offensive stuff is in the libraries .
Libraries are suppose to hold positive material on the shevles .
Book that give knowledge to people in need , not thing contain negative depictions of human life .
Also children should be able to pick up a book , and not feel offened by it .
One night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library .
It was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep .
But one day the dark colored dog was lefted out in the cold while a loving family toke in the white dog , into their warm home .
My brother feel so uncomfortable with that book , he decided to take it back that same night .
Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs .
Offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings , and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book .
Eventhough my brother found a book that he disliked , he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read .
Libraries are fun to go to , but they can contain very offensive thing that can hurt a person's feelings .
