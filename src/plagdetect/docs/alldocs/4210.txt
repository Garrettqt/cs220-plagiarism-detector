What I think about that is that you have your own thoughts about a book , just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't .
There @MONTH1 be something that you like in a book that you don't like in a movie , and there mmay be something that you like in a movie that others @MONTH1 not like in a book that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf .
About magazines if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at then yes they should be taken off the shelf I mean come on now it's a libary there should be certain things that are up there that's al I 'm saying
