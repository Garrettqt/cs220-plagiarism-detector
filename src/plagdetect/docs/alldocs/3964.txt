Is it offensive ?
Should people have the right to take down other people ideas ?
What do you think ; I think so ?
for centuries people have been writing , making video , and , all types of music .
Some consider it a freedom of speech .
Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy .
I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists .
But not all medias are good .
Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as : books , movies , music , etc ... Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon , race , gender , sexuality , and social groups .
@CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 .
This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse .
This is just a few issues with freedom of speech , but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media
