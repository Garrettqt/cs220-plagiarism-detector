If content in a library is considered offensive , @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless .
Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many , but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is .
Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids ( and adults ) .If a book , album , movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind , not exiled in the furthest corner .
When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song , @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating .
Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content .
Although , I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read ( or listen ) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice .
No one wants to settle for less or no frosting , and they should not have to .
