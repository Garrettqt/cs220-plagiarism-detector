Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not ?
Many people have there own personal view on this subject .
Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't .
Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc .
that they themselves have purchased to get .
Now they want them cenored ?
i don't think that is very right .
Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section .
The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read .
Not everyone goes to the library for a book , some go to listen to music , some go to read a magazine , well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get .
How do they expect customers to come back if they 're taking material out of the library ?
The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library .
If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries .
Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility .
My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building , in it's own little wing or something .
Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to .
Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject , and well i gave you mine
