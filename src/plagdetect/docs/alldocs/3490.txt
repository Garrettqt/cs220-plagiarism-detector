The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern , I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason .
The library is not just for the children but also for the adults .
Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them , whether it be in their home , at school , or even while their out in public .
So why alter the library just for the children , when we don't even alter the public for them ?
I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages , then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves .
By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see , hear , or watch it , isn't right to the older people that come to the library .
Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because , by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves , because the adults have no use for them .
Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library , and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read .
Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things .
If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves , then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library .
Their only custmors left would be the children , and that wouldn't be much business , because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being .
There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair .
I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do .
