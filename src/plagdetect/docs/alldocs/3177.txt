Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 I'm writing your newspaper company this letter because I feel the same way Katherine Paterson feels , and we should not be able to have any of the following dirty books , and any sexual books .
Because let's face it they can scar a kid's mind forever , so in my opinion any books with that stuff in the book should not be on the shelf for any public library .
Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought .
Also let me give you a example , let's say a little boy asks were the action books are , the librarian would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too .
I mean at least this is what would happen if we lived in a world where the kids these days read books .
Because the kids these days don't really read books anyway .
If we collected this data nowadays it would be about youtube and twitter and snapchat .
And in my opinion that is all I need to say .
Sincerly your customer @PERSON2 .
