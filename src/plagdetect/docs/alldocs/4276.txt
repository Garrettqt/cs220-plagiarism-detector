What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value .
I believe that all sorts of books , music , and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library .
People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is .
Different types of books explain different types of things .
Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand .
Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings .
Taking music , in my opinion , would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music .
They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless .
People love movies .
It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views .
Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment .
People like different movies and some movies can be offensive .
But , it's not up to anybody else .
Magazines help people keep up with news .
Most of the news can be very offensive .
It is the people around you causing the offensive news .
Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news .
Taking away things that people use to connect with , what they use to escape with , their entertainment , and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way .
Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't .
What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate ?
How would you feel ?
