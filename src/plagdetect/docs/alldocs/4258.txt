I think that no @CAPS1 , Book , @CAPS2 , or any sort of music should ever be takin off the shelf , if u dont like what they say in these @NUM1 catagories dnt wach listen read or anything .
Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt .
I mean think about it is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no .
Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that @CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean .
Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song , book or @CAPS1 it takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on @NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no , no @CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine .
