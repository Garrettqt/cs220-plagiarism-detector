Certain books should be removed from , the library because of the materials an the stuff they show to younger children .
One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures .
Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc.
, would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading .
A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all .
The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist .
They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things .
Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library .
They would also get he wrong idea about peopple and different cultures .
Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading .
Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at .
It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book .
Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them .
Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies .
In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all .
They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book .
That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff .
