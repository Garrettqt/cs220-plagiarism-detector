I dont think that they should remove music , movies , magazinwa , etc.
, Should be tooken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldnt be anything to do in your spaire time but be bored .
I know alot of people couldn't handle being bored .
I know I couldnt handle it if all I was bored all the time because someone took away music .
Now it would be a different story if we never had music , movies , and all that other good stuff .
None would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it .
How would you feel if you had to drive for @NUM1 hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read ?
I 'm thinking you would be really bored im guessing .
