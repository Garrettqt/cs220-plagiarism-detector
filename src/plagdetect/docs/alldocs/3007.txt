I don't believe that certain books , music , magzines , or movies should be removed .
If they are found offensive then that is not my problem .
If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with .
When it comes to any of the mentioned items , sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves .
No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves .
If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves .
That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with .
Anything and everything is educational in it's own way .
Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right .
That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves ?
It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs .
Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that .
It's sad to admit , but there really isn't anything to change that .
It's just easier to live with it .
Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive .
It depends on what you take offence to .
Maybe the writer , director , or composer meant for something to be offensive , maybe they didn't .
It's all based on how you take what they said into thought .
So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves .
For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything .
