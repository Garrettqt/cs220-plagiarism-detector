If you take any of these books off the shelves that would be lik taking away some of our chilldhood .
that wuldn't be the nicest thing to do .
Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was yoour favorite book as a kid .
We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore .
the had to make room for other books .
So if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books .
I mean how wuld you fel if you couldnt share that with your kids ?
I would be upset because my parents told me and i went out and got them from the library and I loved them to So please if you can leave the books alone
