Books , music , movies , and much more , being removed off of the self because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not not mean to get rid of them .
Many enjoy them , and could use them for shool research or topics for a class .
First of all I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people , it was clearly our chioce to buy the music , book , or movie .
We all have different opinions on what 'good ' music or movies are .
I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs , but it is our money and our decision to buy it .
Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it and with all the word and comments then make in the music I can see why adults don't want us to buy it .
In respect for others I think we can turn down the radio , don't make comments to movies , and don't be immature with the books .
Second , All the research and studying we have to do in school , it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with .
Now a days the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over and if they want to do that topic bad enough then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject .
I do realize that it gets out of control with the music , movies , magazines , and books but we know when to settle down and grow up .
Teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things .
We just have to learn to use it with respect .
Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not
