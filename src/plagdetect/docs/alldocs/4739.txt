I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing , but can go too far .
Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing .
If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much .
Removing those small things , however , could grow into a bigger problem .
It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves .
It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental .
A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf .
Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf .
Pretty soon everyone is comming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned .
Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens .
If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive ' piece of literature , film , or artwork .
The original purpose being to block out offensive meterial ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody .
Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some .
In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything .
The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk .
Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others .
Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired .
The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand .
