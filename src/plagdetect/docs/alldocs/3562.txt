'hey ' , I believe that certain materials , such as book , music , magazines , etc.
, shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
First , I know that people have different views appon things such as magazines , books , and music .
And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 be offensive to you , but they aren't offensive to other perople .
Such as music there are all kinds of music out there .
And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt .
Because A lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it .
Second , I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem .
Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine , book , or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive .
So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right .
Third , I 'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it .
But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place .
And yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us .
So you can see , I believe that certain materials , such as books , music , magazines , etc.
, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive .
Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer .
Because So many people have different opinions , and beliefs appon things .
