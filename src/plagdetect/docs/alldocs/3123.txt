I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent .
There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library , but some of it could be useful .
There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library .
When I went home to watch it with my mother , it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive , not to mention awkward and embarassing .
My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie ' @CAPS1 ' .
Although there are some materials that should not be in the library , there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes .
Some people think gay rights , abortion , and teenage sexual activity are offensive .
There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives .
Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual , a daughter who has become sexually active , or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion .
What is offensive to some , @MONTH1 not be offensive to others .
I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials .
If it is educational , it @MONTH1 be useful to some people .
There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world .
As the world evolves , so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world .
