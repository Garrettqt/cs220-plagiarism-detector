Almost everyone in this world reads .
Many people have to read almost every day , people @MONTH1 not realize it but they do .
Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful .
Even if you know how to read a little bit , if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read .
No , I do not think they should take anything off the shelf .
Why would they take anything off the shelf ?
If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it .
Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting .
If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them , who knows how many books we would have left .
people can be offended in the most easiest ways .
We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives , moives can offende people justr the same as books .
I think moives would offend more than a book would .
In conclusion , Books , movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone .
Many people get offended in this word way to easy .
One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it .
Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs
