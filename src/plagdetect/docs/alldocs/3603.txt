I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books , movies , music cds , or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off .
Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library .
Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library .
Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library .
Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library .
Also it would not matter to me how the library is run .
Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me .
Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library .
Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library .
Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it .
Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one .
Finally , it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care .
