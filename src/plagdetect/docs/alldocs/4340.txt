Censorship for the future kids of america .
Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted , disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies .
Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime .
What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex , drugs , money , and violent crimes and gangs .
The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids .
Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder , rape , gang , violence , and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world .
I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wan na file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up .
With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth .
Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth .
But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie .
That is how it should have always been .
