I believe libraries should have all types of books , music , movies , and magazines .
I believe if libraries had limited things that alot of people would not come to the library .
For example , if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it i don't no were else I would go .
The library should have a variety of books if not what if the point of a library .
Some books might be to explicit for a child to read .
For music I think a library should be limited.I think music should be limited because alot of music has cursing in it .
I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library .
I dont think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyways because a library is suppose to be quiet .
But also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed .
Some music might be to bad for some chlidrens ears .
For movies I think they should have an age limited for children .
Thats simple kids should be able to only watch kid movies .
Teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies .
Adults should be able to watch all movies .
That is how it should go .
For magazines they should have all types of magazines .
They should have them from child to adult but in different sections .
For example , All the children magazines should go with the children books .
All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books .
Some magzines are to explicit but the library should make sure the magazines stay in the adult section .
Some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books .
All kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion .
I 've never experience a nasty , or explicit book .
So if anything is explicit keep it in the adults only section .
Every book should be in the library
