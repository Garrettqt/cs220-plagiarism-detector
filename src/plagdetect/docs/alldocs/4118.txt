@CAPS6 are many books out @CAPS6 that , if looked into , have something obsene or vulgar in it .
Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things , the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries .
Authors write or type every word for a reason , whether happy or sad or vulgar .
@CAPS6 is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive ' things .
Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author wanted you to read it , not to just put it @CAPS6 to fill in or to be nasty .
I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down .
The library where I live has sections for children , teens , and adults so that @CAPS6 is no confusion or concern of the content of the book .
You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home .
I personally think that this is a great idea and will comprimise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything .
If the latter was taken in to effect though , some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves , such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 , The @PERSON1 , @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5 , and much more .
Such harsh actions aren't neccasary when a much simpler and more effective way to be accomplished .
Although offesive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready .
No book should be taken off a shelf for its content .
