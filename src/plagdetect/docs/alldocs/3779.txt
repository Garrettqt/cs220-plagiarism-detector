No i dont hink that should happen that would be stupid and im sure alot of people will disagree with it .
one reason is because adults like all of that stuff .
And if they were doing this because kids keep geeting into them .
then just get a door that says @NUM1 and older and put cameras up .
If kids parents complain then at lest you can say that its all in one room and no kids aloud .
this shoudnt be a big deal if your a kid you are going to have to be round all the time when you grow up .
So you might as well get used to it .
it is a big deal if your cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff .
when i was growing up i was around all that stuff and i think i turned out allright
