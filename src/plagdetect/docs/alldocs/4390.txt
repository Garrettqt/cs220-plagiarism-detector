I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended .
There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do .
For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge .
I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first .
So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left .
I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves .
Even though I feel offended I 'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues .
If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason .
Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue .
Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other .
Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued .
Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way .
I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair ' and thats true .
So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this .
So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary .
So when someone is offended thats their problem .
You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen .
