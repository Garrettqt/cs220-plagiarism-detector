Hi , my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library .
There are many , many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as , sexcism , racism , rarted @CAPS3 , pornography .
So i am here today to tell you all about them things .
First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children.Why ?
Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does .
Another thing is sex in books .
I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things .
So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries .
The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2- @CAPS3 movies .
Things such as horror movies , porn , and many more .
So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age .
It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older .
The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines .
Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them .
These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because .
Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet .
So all in all , all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons .
So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying .
Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things
