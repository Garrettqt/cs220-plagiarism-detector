I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf .
On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs .
Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie , nusic , and a magazine .
You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch .
I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i 'd pick out to watch .
On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it .
Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1 , i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title .
Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch .
Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to , but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe .
If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read .
Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney , they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool , but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it .
Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you .
If people didn't get to listen to , read , or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset .
I think people are entitled to their own opinion , although some people's opinions could be rather stupid .
Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to .
