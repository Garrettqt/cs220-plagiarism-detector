Many individuals vist different libraries all over the world everyday .
Some for books , some for magazines , some for movies .
Everyone has different taste so a libary is where they go , because they have absolutley everything .
Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books .
It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research .
There should be no limits on what books , movies , magazines , ect.
, are on the shelf .
Everyone has different beliefes/feelings on what they would like to read or see .
If libraries starting limitting their options , i don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much .
Which means that an indivudal's @CAPS1 could go down .
Reading helps everyone in this world , by learning new vocabualry and just excersizing their own eyes .
By taking away someone's intrest , they won't read as much , or feel as free .
Just because someone doesnt like something , does not mean the next person won't .
If a book or movie , ect.
, is offensive to someone they just just simply not read it or watch it .
No one has the right to take over someones mind of what they are interested in .
However limmiting the age groups for certian items would not be a horrible idea .
Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not approiate for a young child should not be aloud to be seen or checked out by a young child , but that does not mean take it away from others .
