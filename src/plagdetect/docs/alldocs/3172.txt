Should books , magazines , movies , and music be put in higher reaches of children , or should they be left in plain sight ?
Is @CAPS5 fair to not be capable to see a movie , magazine , or even read a book because others in the area believe @CAPS5's offensive in their view ?
If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows , not anyone else .
Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive .
The reason for this is because , @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them , and who would like to read them , but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions .
If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold .
If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track .
There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information , but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to , due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate .
For example , in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade .
@DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned .
The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information .
He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked .
The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out , or I wasn't able to check them out . '
' @CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive , and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves . '
The teacher then says , 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can , how does that sound to you ? '
' @CAPS6 good , at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment , ' said the student .
@DATE1 @TIME1 comes , adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books , and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher .
At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8 .
Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start .
This is why movies , books , magazines , or even music should not be removed from shelves .
Things like this will probably happen , and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault .
If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed , then they should be from their sight , and they shouldn't bother thinking of them .
Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them , then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person .
