Did you know that libraries contain books , movies , music , magazines , etc .
?
Yes !
They have it all , if you ever need something for research or a project just go there .
But if there is something that you do not like , just keep going .
I do not think that the books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
I think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going .
That 'something ' that might offend you , could be helpful to others .
So , now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library just walk away .
It could be helpful to you and others .
If things offend you , how would the next person learn ?
They won't .
Don't only think about your self , think about others in the situation also .
