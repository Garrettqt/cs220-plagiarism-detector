I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books , magazines , etc ... , because people should have the right to read anything that want .
People do not necessairly like reading some things , but if it is important that they research something , or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them .
Take the book , @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 , for example .
In that book it describes kidnapping , and the rape of young girls .
Certain classes would require you to read this book , even though noone would really want to read about that .
Some people have different tastes in movies .
Personally , I prefer horror movies ( but not gory ) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next .
Some people like the really graphic and gory movies , and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf , it would be harder for those people to find them .
Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people .
Who can say where it should stop ?
Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion , but people from other religions would be un-effected by it .
Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it .
It would really offend people , while othre people couldn't care less .
Basically , I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy , and if there is something out there that you do not want to see , you just have to ignore it and leave it alone .
It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it
