BAD @CAPS1 Do you really want your kids to see bad immages or read bad prompts ?
I dident think so !
you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad .
You need to help them have a clere cnochience so when they come across these obsticalls in life they will know what to do .
You could do what my aunt @PERSON1 does .
Whenever she goes through the check out ile at a local @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or other stores she turns the magazines that she thinks is innaproperate around .
My mom and dad say this is a silent protest , because she is hurting no one else she just simply dosent like it .
It makes my dad upset when ever he watches tella vision with us and thier is some thing that they never saw on @CAPS4 like half naked girls on the comershals so he will turn the channel or shut it off .
because he dosent want us exposed the bad thngs of the world .
My mom is the same way but she wont let us watch @NUM1 movies if i wanted to watch thies i was usually at my friends house .
My mom would probably be a little upset .
I think books are ok because you dont see alot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the image i their head .
In conclusion i hope you would feel the same way i do so next time you go through that check out stop and say to your self do i want little eyes to see this .
Then you should turn that maggizne around turn off the @CAPS4 and the music , you should also ead the book so you know what it is about
