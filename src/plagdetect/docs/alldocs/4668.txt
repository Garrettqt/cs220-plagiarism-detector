If they are offensive they sholud be taken off the shelves becuase the little kids would'nt get they .
And i think that they should not be and there and the frist place because almost every body goes to the lidraries .
If i found the offensive they would promble get shut down or who ever put they would be fired .
the kids should not see them or know about them at all .
the offensive books , music , movies , magazines are not most to be found in a lidraries that kids go to .
I think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they got them .
And most pairnts would go talk to the people that did that .
But if that happen to me if my kid came home with one of the offensive magazineas or any thing i would ask them where you get it and then go to talk to the poelpe that runs it .
And most of the people that founds those things would be mad at the kids and its not their promble that someone did that .
And the frist thing they should do is have a @NUM1 or older on the books , movies , magazines , and music if they are in the libraries .
They should not be where the kids go and read books or nothing like that .
They should be where the people that are @NUM1 or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there .
But if the offensive are in libraries people should take them to court offensive books , movies , magazines , and music
