People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries .
They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter .
They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say .
I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why .
I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside , i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside .
I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world .
Children have to learn that , and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to .
I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way .
So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to .
if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen .
let them do what they want to
