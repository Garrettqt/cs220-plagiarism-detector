Should materials in libraries be censored ?
No , i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf .
If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material .
People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad .
What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ?
If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine , and the parents should be watching the kids get .
I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library , because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there .
and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it .
But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library .
So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people .
