I think that no books should be taken away .
I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to .
If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to .
And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave .
If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares .
And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it .
I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want .
And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it .
