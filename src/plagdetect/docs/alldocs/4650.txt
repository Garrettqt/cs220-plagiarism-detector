My opinion on this subject is its not right .
This is a very interesting question .
And im going to tell you why i think the way i do .
Im for it and against it .
Okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it .
Thats how things work .
If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened .
I totally agree on that .
Like ciggerettes .
Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see .
Once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs .
There would be so many conflicts if this happened .
Everyone likes different things .
So i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them .
This goes from kids to adults .
Every age would be bothered by this .
Now this is my against veiw on this subject .
This would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object .
All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad .
Thats how its suppost to be .
We all have are opinions .
We all like different things .
We all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it .
Thats something we have to take in and suck it up .
So on this subject im for both .
I see it both ways because its good and bad .
People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear .
Its part of life .
