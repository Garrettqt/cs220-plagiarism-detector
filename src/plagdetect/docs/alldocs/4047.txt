As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books , movies , magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate .
However this should be their decision and only their's ; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results ; the removal of certain books .
In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them .
When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate .
Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to .
So , if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it ; and disobey parents .
They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education .
So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway .
So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read , listen to , or see because eventually they will see it .
Do you want that ?
