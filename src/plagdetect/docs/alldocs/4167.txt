There are alot of things that people think do do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be tooken down .
I think that if there is somthimg foumd offincive in a library , it should be tooken down immediatley .
Libraries should be a place of comfort , a place to relax , a place to read and enjoy our books not a place were if we find somthing disturbing or offensive we shouldnt come there any more .
Some people might not care about the things they see and some do .
Therefore if i see somthing that offends me and is disturbing to me i will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files .
Now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it @MONTH1 be offends you in the library , then i believe it should be removed from that library .
If people find things less attracctive and offensive it will soon go around and less people will come to that library .
This is how i put it , make the library suitable for others , make them feel at home when they are reading there book , magazine , etc.
, not for you .
It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think
