I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned form their children , but not from the public .
Everyonehas their owen belief in what he or she reads or rights even watches so the library is perfect the way it is .
We can not through out books we find offensive because of our beliefs because somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain relgion or a certain topic .
If we through out all the books and made a library with only the books we wanted we 'd be in a lot of debt because then we 'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place .
So if we have a problem with a book or movie form the library weshould just keep our children awayfrom that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item
