Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned ?
In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray .
The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines .
I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well .
In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library .
The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover .
You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it .
After you read it or you ' r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one .
