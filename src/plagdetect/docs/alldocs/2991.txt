Yes and no , some materials such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc , should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves .
I do think that some materials in those catagories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others , but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them .
I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown , but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too .
If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it , then there is a chance that it can be stopped .
Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances .
Here's another example , like this music artist named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .
She has made some great songs for the past year and a half now .
People have told me that she is part of a group called @CAPS3 and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth ' thereselves .
My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music .
I told my friends that I do not like the fact that she joined this group , but that doesnt mean im gon na stop listen to her music .
Now if she makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends , then that where I draw the line .
What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others , it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible .
