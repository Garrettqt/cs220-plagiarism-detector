In my opinion , censorship of any kind shouldn't exist , especially in libraries .
Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book , @CAPS1 , magazine , or movie .
It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have .
If you take away opinions in books , music , film or magazine/newspaper articles , then you 're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive .
The right to free speech is an important one in the @LOCATION1 , we can have opinions here , we can choose our beliefs , and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing , then they should be allowed .
Writing is a form of expression , writers can express their thoughts , use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters .
Who does one think they are to say it's offensive ?
Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive ?
If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive ' , we wouldn't have anything to read .
Some people @MONTH1 find the @CAPS2 offensive , but we still put that in libraries , some people @MONTH1 find books on wizardry and vampires offensive , yet those are all rage now , we wouldn't take those away .
Things that people find offensive are just opinions -- just like the ones of those of the writers .
It just simply wouldn't work out -- if you want young people to read , you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests , and sometimes that @MONTH1 be 'offensive .
