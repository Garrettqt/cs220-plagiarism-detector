Dear @CAPS1 , To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2 @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book ?
It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
that any person finds offensive .
To this I disagree .
The world @CAPS5 a better place to live , when everyone has a level playing field .
Some information @CAPS5 sensitive , but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself .
Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech , to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country .
To solve a situation as this , we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there , but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint .
Our country has many problems , but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6 .
In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech .
This means that we can publish anything , no matter the inappropriateness of the matter .
This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips .
There was just an example of this , inside the @LOCATION1 , when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6 .
However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom , we can not ban works purely based on the discretion of some .
The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place , with almost nothing a given constant .
This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types .
No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future .
At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation .
The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten .
The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through , be it good or bad .
To block all of this information just can't be done , but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope .
To to create such a restriction , our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works .
Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works , but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections .
A perfect example of this would be off of ' @CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13 ' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher .
That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public , but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age .
As humans we crave information , whether it be via watching , listening , or reading .
To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential .
Many things are offensive , but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive .
Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6 , and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information .
This @CAPS5 a very good thing , but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them .
We need to protect our freedoms , but also protect our children .
To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want , and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians .
