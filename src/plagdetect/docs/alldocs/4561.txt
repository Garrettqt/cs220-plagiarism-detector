I believe if i worked at a library , if I found multiple idems that has profanity , rasicm , slang.I agree with taking Magazines , @CAPS1 , Music books , @CAPS2 books , etc.
, I wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism , etc.I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books .
If i worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults , young children to check out .
How would it make you feel if I didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it ?
I would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library .
I also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children .
I think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf , not only I would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see .
This is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.I would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library .
Lastly I think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books .
Also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year olds and on up .
I hope this inspires you .Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about
