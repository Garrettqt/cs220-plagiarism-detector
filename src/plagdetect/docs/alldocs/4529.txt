Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4 , the artedclie that you writte last week really get to me .
The one about do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people .
i went back and fore on this , first i was thinking that if it was offensive to some people then we sould take it down bucese if it offensiveds people then why are we selling it to the people , but then i get to thinking agian and i was like people have the right to freedom of space and if this how they what to talk then let them space there mind .
this great courtry of ares was made on the right that every one is made the same and every one inteialed to the freedom of space .
if people what to talk like thet do in there music or act they way they what to in there movies its there life if yuo dont like it dont buy it are even pay an attient to it.say if i was a raper like lil wayne or some one like that i would care about the people who are talking the way they are bucese it is my way of tilling the world how i feel about thing that are on my mind.if some one writtes some thing in a book that you dont like dont go all out and go on tv shows to make fun or till how you feel writte i letter to the author and till them how yuo feel about the topic .
every person black , white , yellow , brown , or even green has the right to freedom of space .
was give to us for a ressen and i think it was for that even if you have idia but you think it is supted just say it bcuese some people think that is amazing or not .
but every one is created the same so treat people the way you wont to be treated .
i would like to thank you for reading this .
your artedcile really open my eyes to the world and how i sould see it .
thank you for writting it .
sincely , @PERSON1
