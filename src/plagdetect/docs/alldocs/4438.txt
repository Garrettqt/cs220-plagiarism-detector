Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's , magizines and etc .
should be taken off the shelf because .
Book's help people read and concentrate .
In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied .
Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past .
Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail .
Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them .
Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after , you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far .
In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live .
We have gotten this far to go to the top .
At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance , do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now , a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do .
My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning .
We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away .
I love book , s and I hate to see them go away .
these book , s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up .
Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's .
Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's .
@CAPS5 would devestate our country , states , cities , school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you 'll make our reader's very happy .
Thank you for reading this and have a nice day
