Take it @CAPS1 ?
How do you take it when people come out with magazines , movies , or music that is extremely offensive to you ?
How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things ?
The truth is we can not stop them , their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere .
It is all over the internet and you can't control that .
If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion , and that opinion should be taken seriously .
They shouldn't have inappropiate things in public stores or places children can go .
That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids .
Some people should just know better and take it @CAPS1 .
Almost every day that i go online , i see something on the side of the website advertising some kinda of pornograghy site .
Its unbelievible how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see .
If they 're going to continue to do this , @CAPS2 needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites .
I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages .
I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others .
Selling movies , magazines , and music saying or doing things that are rebelious is easy money for opper teens and older people .
They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things , everyone loves to watch , read , or listening to something funny .
So basicly we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that .
the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day .
It should die down eventually .
We can only hope for the best
