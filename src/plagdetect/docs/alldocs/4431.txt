Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of .
What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books ?
My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it .
I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem .
If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them .
That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read .
If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it .
Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf .
They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways .
I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of
