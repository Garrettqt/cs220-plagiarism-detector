Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public .
This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material .
Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries .
The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves .
A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them .
The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them .
Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people .
There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials .
Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it , but they would all be taken away to somewhere else .
I think that it depends how offensive the materials are , as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves .
Although I am sort of split on this issue , there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves .
Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country , and they should not have access to them .
We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt
