Communities have many different types of people that live in them .
Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal .
Some of these things cause conflict .
A library , for example , is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts .
Most libraries are open to the public .
Therefore , many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books , movies , magazines , and music .
Having many different kinds of people sharing this material , the libraries must try to have material to please everyone .
This is where the conflict begins .
While trying to please everyone , some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive .
Now for the big question : Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together ?
The answer to this big question is no .
Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community .
People are different and believe in different things .
Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone .
For example , things such as religion .
Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive , but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion .
Just because one person takes it offensively , doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them .
Libraries are for all kinds of people .
Just because one person finds the material offensive , doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else .
If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves , there would be no material left .
People believe in different things .
That is the way it always has been and more than likely , the way it will always be
