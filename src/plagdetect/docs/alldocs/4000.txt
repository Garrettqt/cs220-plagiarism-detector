Libraries have so many books , and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves .
If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read .
So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything .
I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim , any book is a good book .
If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it , the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny .
People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read , or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea .
If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading .
Most people like to read about mested up things .
Music and Movies are a different story .
Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means .
But movies show you how bad things are shown .
Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool .
But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad
