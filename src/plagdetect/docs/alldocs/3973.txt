Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you ?
If you said yes , how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me ?
Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god .
Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf .
In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it .
That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to .
For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom .
In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends .
It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to , And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom
