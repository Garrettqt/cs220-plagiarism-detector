Throughout time , fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive .
It @MONTH1 be the way they were brought up , or simply what they beleive .
I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves .
Everyone has one life , and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right .
We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles , and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals , beliefs , and customs of everyone in the world .
If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation , then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will .
Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive , I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing .
There is such a thing as mass agreement , but there is also a thing called mass ignorance , and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part .
I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child .
That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else , because they have undeniable duties as parents , and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind
