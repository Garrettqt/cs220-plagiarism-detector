Books are a form of history , each telling a story from the past .
in history we dont block any offensive events that take place so why should we removed any books that have offensive material in them .
it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools .
books are a very important learning tool in todays schools and there is somthing new in every book that a kid can learn from .
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing .
and doing this on purpose would be aginst everything that schools stand for .
there are many diffrent janras of books , but not everybody loves every jonra if a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to there culture , wich most likely will have offensive language and events play out .
if you were to take this away from a youngadult in school ; once more this person would be missing out on books because nows they are not intersted at any of the books in the libary .
if you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opertunity you shouldnt do it .
but the fact is there any many reasons why you shouldnt remove any literture from libary shelves
