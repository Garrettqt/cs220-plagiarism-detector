Im against cencorship for good reasons .
Everyone is for censor ship well im on a different perspective .
if ur not old enough to get a movie or a book thats for a reason .
On another note if you are then it shouldnt matter .
People should have their own choice .
If they want to go out and get a rated @CAPS1 movie and watch it with their kids thats their own choice .
Its defantly not the person who makes the movies choice to censor cusswords and stuff out .
Thats why they make edited cds so people can by them instead .
People have different beliefs .
and its whatever they believe in is how it should go .
and if somebody else with differant beliefs dont like that then i geuss they neede ta write @NUM1 paragrapgh like im doing now .
Also people want everthing cencored out .
eventually theyre isn't going to be nothing to read watch or listen to .
So all u people that want everything to be cencored I hope ur happy when the world has nothing to do because of you .
