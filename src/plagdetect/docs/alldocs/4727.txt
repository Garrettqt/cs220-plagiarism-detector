This is along the lines of personal thought .
Some people can be happy with things , while others disagree .
Unless its racist or sexist no one has any right at all to say something can't belong .
If someone doesn't like a book than walk away from it don't ponder at why its there , someone else @MONTH1 want it .
So I dont like this topic personally but i am ok with writing about it .
Its not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where , unless it is rightfully owned by the individual .
I know there are many things I dont like but I dont try and get things moved and banned .
Its there people want to read it .
Plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down ( @CAPS1 of sadness or rejection ) .
Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist , If that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of .
People have the right to say they are not happy with that but if they just dont like the topic but others do than they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it .
Now if the title @CAPS2 says what the book is about than walk away don't pay attention to it .
People @MONTH1 use it for research or something in the future .
Now people @MONTH1 be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge , @CAPS3 or fight over stupid little things .
Thats the people that always got things handed to them which I imagine is why this topic came up .
So that is my thoughts and believes about the topic of Censorship .
It doesn't matter where , in school or at a library it is there because someone is/was interested in the item .
I know this is my thoughts and believes , people @MONTH1 completely think what i wrote it stupid , some @MONTH1 think its smart .
Its just the culture you grew up in and @CAPS1 of mind you are in that current time and place .
