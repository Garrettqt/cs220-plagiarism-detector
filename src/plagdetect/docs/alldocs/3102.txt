Picture yourself walking through the library with your child .
Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners .
Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song .
I agree with the censorship in libraries today .
Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem .
Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as ' @CAPS1 ' do not reach their shelves .
Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive .
I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids .
That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money , sex , and abuse .
Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions .
One example is a teen pregnancy book .
The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life .
Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier .
Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think ?
In conclusion , censorship should be kept in libraries .
It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing , or how they snatched the wrong idea .
Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment .
