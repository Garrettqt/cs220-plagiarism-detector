No , because people likes different books , movies , music , and magazines .
If people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries .
They will go some where else to get the movie or what ever there getting .
Some peoplpe want them to remove it but some don't want them to be removed .
If you don't want your kid's to read them , leison to them , or whatch them don't let them get them
