Should certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, be removed from shelves if they are found offensive ?
I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons .
Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate .
If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they 're own oppenion .
I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision , not everyone has the same view on the material .
Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it .
Everyone has they 're own oppenion , some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they 're own way
