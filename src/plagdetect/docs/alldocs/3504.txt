I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive .
I think it should be that way about every thing .
If something is offending you then you should say something about it .
Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time .
Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it , unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it .
So when something happens that I don't like , I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is .
I rairly change my ways though .
Some times that is a bad thing though , but who hasn't mad a mistake or two ?
This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think .
So I really don't get offened .
I do know some people the get offened easy though .
I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time .
To me thats no fun , I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke .
If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa .
I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know .
If you know of a book , movie , anything that will or might offened you , just dont read it again .
It might not offened the next reader .
They might really like the book or whatever it is .
All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you .
After a wile you will forget about it .
I guess if it really really bothered you , and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it .
If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay .
