Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves ?
I believe that certaine materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves .
These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people .
Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person .
People take things differently than other people might .
For example , a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive , while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him .
Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing .
I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look , purchase , or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve .
He or she is not forced to buy , read , or watch what is offending them .
The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them , it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing .
Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves .
People have the right to things that they enjoy .
A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it .
Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things .
