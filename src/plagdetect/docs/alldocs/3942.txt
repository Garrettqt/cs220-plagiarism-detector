Things that mean so much to just one person @CAPS1 to start this off , I am going to say Katherine Paterson is saying / @CAPS2 what is correct.They 're is alot of @CAPS3 around this world that is very senceitive about there things in there house and around there life that they wouldnt want anyone to touch .
Or be around .
One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my @CAPS4 is the @CAPS5 that my @CAPS6 gave to us right before he passed away .
Me & my @CAPS4 have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time .
But we just cant get the nerve to do it .
We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that @CAPS5 and just grab ahold of it .
@CAPS1 me and my @CAPS9 do not like that .
So we say something .
Thats one thing that we @CAPS10 like for anyone to touch .
Because it means so much to us !
Most @CAPS3 think we are crazy because we @CAPS10 like anyone to be around or touch it , but all I have to say is that there is other @CAPS3 around this area that is more crazy about there things being touched .
For example : ' @CAPS10 be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I @CAPS10 want you to knock it off , so get away from it ! '
That is something that my bestfriends @CAPS11 had said before .
& she still feels the same way still to this day !
But I mean its just how we feel about everything around us that means alot .
But to get back to the situation about why do @CAPS3 get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall , or things that are in cases and thats where they have been for years and years .
Its because it means so much to them .
Its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe .
It just because it means so much to them , & when I say means alot to them , I mean a bunch bunch !
!
There just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered .
Just try to understand what there trying to say to you .
Because it could mean so much .
& you could get to the point to watch out for it also .
Just to help out .
But the store that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing .
& she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her .
You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of @CAPS3 that have impotant things in there life , & you could be one of them .
Just try to see & feel how alot of other @CAPS3 do around the world around you .
Just have to remember whats important to someone and help keep an eye out with them .
& because a good friend to everybody else .
