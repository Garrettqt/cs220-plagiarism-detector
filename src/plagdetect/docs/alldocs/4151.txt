Do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , should be removed from from shelves if they are found offensive .
No i dont believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive .
Many kids today are into gang realted activites because they see parents , older siblings , or even friends into so they decide to do the same because they feel its cool .
Teens now days really dont care the movies , or the music .
Not all music or movies are offensive .
So we cant blame that .
We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies listen to uncut music .
We choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies .
The people who make their uncut music or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies dont care who watches it or what affects it would have on children and neither does the parents .
They 're just trying to make a living like everyone else .
If parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place .
Just because some say that offensive movies , music or even magazines should be removed doesnt mean its there fault .
Its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies
