I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE ' , or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it , like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things .
For example in my opinion there are some books , music , movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive , and not just for me or other people too .
Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images , videos or bad words that should not be use for everybody to hear or see .
You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you , and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember , we have the power to talk , read and write what we think is best .
I 'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music , I 'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future , not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can , because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids .
This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth , if you think something is being bad say it , and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else
