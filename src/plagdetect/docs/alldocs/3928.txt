Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it , whether it is what the book is about , the curse words in them , or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups .
Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not ?
I dont think any of the books , or magazines should be censered .
If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them .
The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care .
I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say .
Should the movies you get at libraries be censered ?
I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching .
The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it .
The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it .
Should all books.magazines , music , or movies from libraries be censered ?
No .
If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit .
If the book , movie , magazine , or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out .
A public library can but there are mostly adults there .
The kids should know what they can and cant watch , read , or listen to , so they should know better than to get something they cant read , watch , listen to , or look at .
Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read .
Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell
