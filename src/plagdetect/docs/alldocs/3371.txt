When one person is giving a right to do something , then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing .
But every so often , you have someone that abuses their rights to something .
I belive that all books , music , movies , magazines , and everything else has a right on a library shelf .
And they shouldn't be romoved if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads , there will be some kind of offence in it .
I also belive that all books , music , movies , magazines , and everything else has a pupose to it .
And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published than , it should have a good message worth delivering to people , even if it is a little offensive .
I 've read a few books , watched a few movies , and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way .
But , considering that there was more of a purpose to it , and the purpose being a good message , I liked the few movie and songs that most people would say its 'junk ' .
I don't have alot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive , but the few songs , movies that are offensive to even me , I belive that there was some kind of good message there .
I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book , a peice of music , a magazine , or anything else off a library shelf .
Because everything has some kind of purpose to it , and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover
