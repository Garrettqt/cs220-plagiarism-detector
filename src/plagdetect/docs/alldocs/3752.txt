No , I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive .
I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want .
One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want .
People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books , magazines , music , and movies .
If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library .
If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library .
This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 .
''
@CAPS5 of speech '' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to .
if others find it offensive , then don't reed it .
Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to .
If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right .
One of my personal experiences is that I love music , so do my two best friends .
One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it .
He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them .
If someone found them `` offensive '' I would have never got to hear how good they were .
This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries .
not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history .
libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information , it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create .
