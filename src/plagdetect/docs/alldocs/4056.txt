Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves ?
I know that most people who agree that it would 'better ' our kids if the didn't read or listen to certain things .
But , what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self ?
I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of it contens .
If I look at a certain book and think , ' @CAPS1 book is offending me and my beleives , ' then I should just not read the book .
Just becauseit is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offened someone else .
Every book that has ever been written has effect someone , either in a good way or a bad way .
Does that mean they have the right to say , 'take them off the shelves ? '
I remember when I was in second grade , there was these girl in my class who's mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked .
The parent was extremly engery at the teacher and , at that time , I didn't know why.Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying .
The teacher never played the music in class again and was to afraid to play anyother type of music .
Since everyones views are different , by the time every person took off the books that offended them , there would be no books left .
As Katherine Paterson put it , 'But if I have the right to remove that book form the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
In conclusion , I strongly think that books , weather they offended someone or not , should be kept of the selves .
Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with .
