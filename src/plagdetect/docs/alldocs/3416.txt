I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage .
Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars , slavrey and books with curse words in them .
School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups .
If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out .
The music , magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song .
Movies should be age appropiate too .
Thats why libraries have sections for babys , toddlers , pre teens , teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gon na find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section .
Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section .
Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people .
Besides no ones making you check out that book
