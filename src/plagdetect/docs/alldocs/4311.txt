I believe that certain materials such as books , music , movies , and magazines should not be removed from shelfs if someone thinks they are offensive .
Just because one person finds them offensive doesnt mean that they should be taken away from others who @MONTH1 like them .
People are different , therefore we like different types of things .
Different music , books , movies , and magazines .
If you find it offensive , dont listen look or read it .
Listen to the music you like , watch the movies you like , and read the books and magazines you enjoy .
But just because you dont like something dont try and take it away from those that do .
People are very different in many ways .
But let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes .
Censorship has always been an issue but i believe that if people would just stick to what they know and like and leave everything and everyone else alone all would be ok .
I understand that some people might find some things that are on the shelfs today offensive .
But if you dont like it dont look at it or listen to it .
Let it go and stick to what you know and like .
After all the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same .
