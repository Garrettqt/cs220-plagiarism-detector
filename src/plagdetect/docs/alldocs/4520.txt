Censorship Should certain materials ( books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, ) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is .
If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it , then it shouldn't be allowed .
Or , the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to .
It depends on the level of intelligence , maturity , and age of the people who have access to these materials .
I don't think these materials should be removed , but restricted .
Some of it should be left up to the school or library , but it is also a responsibility of the parents .
If a child has permission to access a certain material , then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate .
Sometimes the guardians views @MONTH1 not be the same as a the library or schools , but it's mostly up to the guardian .
Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence .
Over all , I don't think materials such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents , teachers and/or school board memebers , and/or library staff .
Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child , doesn't mean it should be banned from another .
Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable , therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person .
If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material , then simply don't let them access it .
If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access , you can express that , but others @MONTH1 not agree .
Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them , but not a ban .
