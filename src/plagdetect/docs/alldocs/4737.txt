I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf .
The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed .
Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others ?
I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed .
With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book , movie , song , or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed .
