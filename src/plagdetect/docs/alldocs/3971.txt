Censorship in libraries should not be allowed .
I believe that even if books , music , movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense , they should still be left there .
They are apart of our history and the history we 're creating .
If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine , there's a big chance they will end up reading it .
There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today .
You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer .
Also , censoring in libraries , where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable , can make people rebel and even put the library out of business .
From what i 've observed , most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already .
Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored .
A lot of books and movies , great ones even , contain some offensive content but they are classics .
Generations , one after the other , have enjoyed them .
Now tell me , who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested ?
Everyone should have the right to these books , magazines , movies , and music .
Libraries should not censor them .
