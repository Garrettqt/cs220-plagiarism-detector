Do we have the right to take books ?
Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries .
Everyone has their own opinions .
There are so many things that effect our opinions .
Our beliefs , life styles , way of thinking , culture , and the list goes on .
I 'm sure I could think of certain books , movies , music , and magazines that I dont like and could just do without .
Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials ?
It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish .
Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information .
Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely .
Music especially .
There are wide ranges of music from rap , rock , oldies , screamo , classical , country , alternative and the list goes on .
I dispise country ; I go for the alternative and classical music .
I know a lot of people who love it though .
All the old people i know hate all the rap .
Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are .
So no , I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive .
We cant hide from the world .
I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things .
If we remove thing materials we dont care for , others will remove the ones you like and so on .
So then were left with nothing .
Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read , listen to , and watch what we enjoy
