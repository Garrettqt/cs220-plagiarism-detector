I belive if the books , music , movies , magazines and etc .
are offensive and are bad that they should be removed , the reason being is because of younger children .
Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them .
Since there are books , music , movies , magazines and etc .
that are bad and offensive , then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them .
Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me .
There are more bad things in them then in books or music .
Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that .
If there happen to be a book , music , movie , or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk , and let them know what you think about it .
I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe .
They should steel be aloud to have censorship books , music , movies , and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't .
So therefore to keep everything sepreate , and there shouldnt be no problem .
