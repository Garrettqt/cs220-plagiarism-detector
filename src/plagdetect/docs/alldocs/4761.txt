Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on .
Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see .
The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state .
If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves .
If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything .
What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different .
Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with .
So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with .
Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it .
It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president .
@PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate .
People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1 .
I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S .
But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton .
It was uncalled for to begin with .
I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question .
I 'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president .
