Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries .
I do not believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not .
Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way .
What one person might not like the next person might love .
They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material .
Then maybe the library should consider removing the item .
Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they 're going to read or what kind of movie they 're going to watch .
It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive , its many things to choose from .
How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it ?
They would be upset and disappointed about situation .
In conclusion , I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense .
I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts
