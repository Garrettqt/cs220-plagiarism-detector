What is censorship ?
Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions , and it can aslo be called common courtsy .
The real question is what are we limiting ?
Censorship is not something to support .
Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate , its taking away the value and fun out of education .
Though many @MONTH1 disapprove , libraries shouldn't censor their books , movies , or music because of that .
Some @MONTH1 find that ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1 ' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the ' @CAPS4 ' word .
There is also some arguement to that , there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the ' @CAPS4 ' word offensive , but not in this case .
They say that it brings more educational value to the book , because in the day of @PERSON1 the ' @CAPS4 ' word was an excepted word .
Thats just how it was back then .
Back then and now censorship is hiding reality .
People who write , sing , and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate ' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free .
The 'inapropriate ' language , or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said .
By using censorship you are sheltering the world .
Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality .
Is that the right choice ?
Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves ?
Or should we let them understand how it really works
