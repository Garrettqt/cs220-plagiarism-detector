I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored , but I don't matter , right ?
I am the kid that has no choice in the matter .
@CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see ?
I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules .
Like buying a rated ' @CAPS2 ' movie , or game for their kid that is @NUM1 , and not @NUM2 years old , but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law .
I say shrew the law , because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4 , its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things , not the goverment .
I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly , and I think we should .
@CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age : @CAPS3 ?
I wish I knew @CAPS3 , but I dont .
Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them .
For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation .
I am not saying that this is true , I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen .
Video games , They are my weakness I admit , but I don't see a reason for games to be censored .
When people say things like ' @CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders . '
@CAPS4 makes me frustrated .
There is not one single thing that proves that .
I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life , and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4 .
Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world .
Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life .
I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place .
Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad , and never watch/read @CAPS4 ?
Where did they hear @CAPS4 from ?
I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self .
I can see the headlines now , ' @CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders . '
Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't .
What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs .
Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs , and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't .
