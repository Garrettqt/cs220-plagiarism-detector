Nowadays , children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine .
Some magazines , books , and movies that are age appropriate .
Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines , books , and movies .
Should we remove these inappropriate items ?
Can we somehow get kids to not see them ?
Children are very curious .
They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can .
When they see inappropriate items on library shelves , what do we do ?
Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children .
Instead , there should be a rating system on the books and magazines .
Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate ; books should have those ratings too .
If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids , then they can show the libraian their @CAPS1 .
Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age .
Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library .
It could be a section that kids could not enter .
Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate .
The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity .
Children can look onto the shelves , but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out .
Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read .
I believe that's the most we can do .
