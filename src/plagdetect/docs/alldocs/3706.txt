Turn @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I see a book that I don't particularly care for , I simply put it down .
I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 be offensive to a single person , or group of people .
Any time I look through the library , I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate .
However , @CAPS2 I see these books , I don't make a big deal about it .
I just put that book down and continue my search .
I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive .
Also , there are many people that find The @CAPS3 offensive .
If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries , then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature .
Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists , I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries .
I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution ; but because of our freedom of speech , he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs .
As you can so clearly see , I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs .
However , @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art , I think that a variety makes us unique .
If everyone read the same books , listened to the same music , and watched the same movies , then we could have a very boring culture .
That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded !
