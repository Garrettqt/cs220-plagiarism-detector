Dear news people , I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books .
I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do .
What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs , sex , abuse , bad language , and so on you get what I 'm saying .
I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf .
It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem .
People can just not pick the book up and look for another book .
I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree .
If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex , and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would .
It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb .
So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading .
There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to .
