I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive , the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is .
If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist , then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff .
Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does , doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library .
I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive , there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him , that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them .
In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson , she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left .
If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there , because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day .
What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything
