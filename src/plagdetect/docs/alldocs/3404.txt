Censorship in Libraries In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful .
There are also a lot of magazines , music , and movies .
A lot of the movies are adult movies , but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries .
Most of the books , magazines , and movies are all reachable by little children .
I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there .
When I went to the library as a kid , I went with my parents .
We would go there and mainly go to the kids section .
I can also remember going with my grandparents .
I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something .
I can not remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive .
I 've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me .
I 'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive , but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I can not do .
If the libraries do have books that are offensive , they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids .
I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read .
I tend to not read very many books about the world .
I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that .
Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars , so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on , if they are .
If the libraries have offensive books , but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them , than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves .
Some adult @MONTH1 come into the library looking for one of these books , so then they can ask and find them .
So in my opinion , I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves .
