Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ?
YES !
Children shouldnt be exposed to certain things .
Some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages .
Children should read books that meet their age group .
If children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way .
Parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them .
Children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them .
Certain books , magazines , music , and movies are to explict for kids these days .
I think they should all be blocked and out of children reach .
If children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act .
Children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them .
If kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today !
I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children .
Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids .
Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @MONTH1 appear offense .
It will mean that they 'll doing their job as a good parent .
Sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them .
Parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because , sometimes kids would run over you .
I know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness !
Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this .
In conclusion explict magazines , books , and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids .
It might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them
