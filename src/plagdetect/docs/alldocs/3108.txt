Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about , whether that material is a book , movie , or magazine .
Anyone can use the library , and it is a valuable resource to many people .
So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves ?
In past years , censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports .
In almost all cases , library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library .
I have to say that I agree with them .
People have a right to choose what books they want to read , what movies they want to watch , and what music they want to listen to .
People have opinions ; people disagree .
What one person loves , another person could hate .
But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons .
I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual , and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource , then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material .
In conclusion , censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong .
It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves .
Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material , and censorship makes that impossible
