When people think of libraries they picture this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet.Or they just picture this books every where .
But libraries today has be way more improved and advance with music , movies , and etc .
When i was young I never really like libraries because they seem boring to me.Thats why I wasn't good read either until I was in the six grade because I discover the library was actually cool place .
They different thing to do like look up books , music , or movies you can check out the libraries .
Or sometimes you migth have magazines you can check out too .
Then at the libraries there people who don't like it because of the music , movies , and etc.This reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens.Thats why the faithful and ones go to the libraries everyday take the new things offense to the library .
When it all boil down this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was offense book talking about the whites treated the negreos back then .
The reason say that is because old tradition in the library are like the whites in the story and the new things in library are like the negreos who was outcasted by the whites.Then in book it took one little girl to settle diference and knows whats right and wrong .
Thats why I think instead of banning or remove stuff we should have disscusion.Which we can come to adgreement keep new ideas in the libraries.When do keep the ideas maybe we can make a section for thet new ideas so the people comes to library wouldn't get offend
