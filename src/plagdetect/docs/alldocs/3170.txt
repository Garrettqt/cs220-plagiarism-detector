I dont think we should not take books , Music , Movies , and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us .
If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me .
Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like .
One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart .
The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read .
So I think that it is a wast of paper .
The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3 .
Their are lot's of music out there I dont like .
One of them is @CAPS5 .
I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do .
The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7 .
The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good .
The last type of music is some of todays rap .
I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words .
Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like .
The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11 .
I did not get the hole plut of that movie .
The next one @CAPS12 of the corn .
Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town .
The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies .
I just did not like them ok ?
I think all of these things are offensive .
But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away .
There are thing people like but I dont like them .
Their things that my friend like but I dont like .
Their thing I like and they dont like .
But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like .
But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world
