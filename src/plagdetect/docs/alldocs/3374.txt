We are very blessed to have this available because if someone can not afford cerain books , they can always rely on the library .
Many people have been very thankful for this system .
If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive , what would happen ?
More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest .
Everyone is titled to their own opinions .
Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library .
There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library , that does not mean you have to read all of them .
There are also many different genres of novels , movies , music , and magazines .
Everyone has interests in different types .
If people all liked the same things , would not life be boring ?
