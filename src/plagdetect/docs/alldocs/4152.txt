I certainly don't believe books , magazines , etc .. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they 're offensive to a certain amount of people .
For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there .
Also , just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want .
Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities , sports stars , etc ... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf .
If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material , because some people @MONTH1 like it .
Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today , and read stories that were told for generations ?
If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf ; and act like you never picked it up .
