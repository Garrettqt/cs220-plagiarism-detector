I believe that the book that none of us read .
It should not be on the shelf of any book store i think if the grow up does read it no child should have the right to .
Also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store .
Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldnt have any way to get some of this rated r music centrain music shouldnt be on shelfs for little kids to get a hold to .
So now lets get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows .
No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing and movies because no child should be expose to such things that grow up are most likely expose to .
That is another way that young children are doing half of the things that they doing the peoples that make certain movies need to think about the children how they would act toward the ones they make .
Most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea .
When magazine are fill with alot of he say she say things the kids in the world do nothing but think its foreal or ok to do that is spent off the wrong message to the young children .
And i know you are thinking to yourself like how is that true well kids these days listen to what ever they think is right and half of these magazines make things sound so real .
