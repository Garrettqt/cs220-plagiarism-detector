I do not think that materials , such as books , music , movies , and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive .
I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things , with reglion , culture , and sexaually .
Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know .
People are not going to look at things the same .
Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently .
If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves .
One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us .
No more books , music , movies , and magazines .
Let face it everyone have different belifts , values , and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me .
I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again .
Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again .
Easy as that .
Materials give us resources and we learn new things .
If we didn't have materials like books , music , movies , and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are .
American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind .
So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer
