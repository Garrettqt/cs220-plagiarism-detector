In the book ' @CAPS1 @NUM1 ' , books are outlawed .
In such a society , owning a book would result in recieving a punishment .
Without books , @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment .
The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government .
@CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition .
Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out , there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive .
However , if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out , @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away .
A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 . '
@CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery .
@ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man , @PERSON6 , and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1 .
@PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period .
He was the first author to do @CAPS4 .
Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way , the book contains the n-word multiple times .
@CAPS4 word is not acceptable today , and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work .
However , @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon .
@PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method .
If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries , he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature .
'
@ORGANIZATION2 ' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison .
During his time at @LOCATION2 , he discovers that he is a homosexual .
He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell .
These relationships are described in detail .
If one were to read the surface of the book , he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison .
However , @CAPS4 is not the case .
@PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life .
He also had problems with his parents and brother .
In ' @PERSON2 ' , he wrote about his own feelings through his characters .
@CAPS4 story is not about sex , but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people .
If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries , @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with .
Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question .
What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike ?
The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas , concerns , and experiences .
Media helps to enlighten , persuade , and educate people about important issues .
While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language , they also have a deeper meaning .
