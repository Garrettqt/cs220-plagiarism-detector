In @LOCATION1 , everyone wants censorship .
Mainly because they dont want be the outcast .
Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in @LOCATION1 .
In some ways , censorship is necessary and in other ways , some people just want attention .
If all different races want censorship , then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people ?
Essentially , the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction .
For example , if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make , that might be insulting to another group of people .
then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book , which another group of people dislike , and it goes on and on .
So for the censorship towards different groups of people , there will have to be some tolerance .
On the other hand , young children are in need of censorship .
They grow and mature everyday , developing physically and mentally .
So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them , they would read it and accept is as standard .
And when they read bad things like that , they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives .
We are all different , and interpret things in different ways .
So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong , someone right around the corner @MONTH1 think that its just normal .
If you question someones movie or song , in the scheme of things , your questioning their judgement , and thats unfair to them
