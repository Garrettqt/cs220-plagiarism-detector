Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive ?
Say , maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs , alcohol or even sex ?
Well , some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently ' pick up this book and read it .
It could scar them mentally for life .
Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens .
They are too young to learn about drugs , alcohol and/or sex .
If a kid picks up a book about sex , which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf , what would they say to their parents ?
'
@CAPS1 , look what I found . '
is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent .
The parent , in shock , could sue the library for having such an offensive book .
However , some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive .
It might 'provide ' good information for their lives or even someone else's life .
@CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books , not their children .
It can and will mentally scar them for life .
The library could do simple things , like for example : they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines , ect in there .
Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older .
That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer .
Us children are always curious to know things , especially when we are growing up .
We 'll ask about drugs , alcohol and even sex when the time is right .
But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2 .
The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3
