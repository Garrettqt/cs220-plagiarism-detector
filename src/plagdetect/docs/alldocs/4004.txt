I feel that u have the right to chouse to remove setian books , movies , music , magazines but only if they are not apropreat for some people and children .
Some people like thim others do not it all depends on who you are .
If I go to a library and the books I want are on the restricted list , the library should have a small fee some were arould @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 depending on the typ of book .
For instance if i wanted the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 and it was restrected i wouls pay something like a redbox rental fee .
That is what I think about restrecting sertion items from the library .
