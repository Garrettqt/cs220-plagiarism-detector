Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal .
There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people .
To solve the problem , everything should not be censored .
Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it ?
I believe it should be a persons choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive , they should simply put it down .
The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 ' has offended many people .
I have read it and was not offended .
I found it very interesting and educational .
Many people think the book should be censored .
But if it is censored , the story would completely change and it would not be the same .
I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in @LOCATION1's history .
If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves , and all the books offensive to another taken away , what would be left ?
Little kids books about kittens ?
Well that's just lovely .
I am very much against censorship .
I believe that if a material is offensive to you , then you shouldn't read it or listen to it .
But don't ruin it for the rest of us
