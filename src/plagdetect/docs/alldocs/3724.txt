Well to begin my Persuasive @CAPS1 .
THATS @CAPS2 @CAPS3 !
!
!
How could they !
?
Dont we have a say in this ?
....
Well .... WE SHOULD !
!
!
!
This is a little bit about what i think of this letter .
I think that if books , movies , music , magazines , or anything else is offensive , then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right , and its @CAPS2 cuel , and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them .
In my experenice , I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me .
It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old .
My parents and I where there for some movie or something , and we were looking at some books that were there , and came across a book called ' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 ' And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the reglion I was raised in , and they @CAPS2 talked about there feelings on faith , and how they thought of it .
And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the @CAPS6-I- @CAPS6- @CAPS8- @CAPS9 .
And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about .
And if you read that book , it made my question everything i belived .
So to rap up my thoughts and feelings .
I think it shouldn't be there for people to read , like i said before .
People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple .
All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter , and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too .
