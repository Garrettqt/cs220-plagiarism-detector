Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship .
From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book .
In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart .
Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue .
The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 .
The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race .
The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs .
I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles .
The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v .
I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults
