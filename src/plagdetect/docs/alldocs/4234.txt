Censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have .
I think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read .
You don't want the kids reading anything thats too mature for them right ?
Libraries are found all over the @LOCATION1 .
A lot of people say , ' @CAPS1 , well they shouldn't even have the book there in the first place . '
@CAPS2 think about this , maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read .
Or option two , dont have your kid go to a @CAPS3 library .
@CAPS3 , which let me explain , is @CAPS3 .
Which means the whole community can go pick out something .
A @CAPS3 library is suppose to have a variety so anybody can find a book they would like to read .
Yes some things are very inappropriate for kids , doesn't mean we can't have it in a @CAPS3 library .
Just make sure that you know what your kid reads .
If you do that you should be fine , and your kid will be the same .
That's how i feel about censorship in a library .
Its @CAPS3 , so it's meant to have everything .
Which everything includes the good and the bad .
I think some people just have to live with it .
So I honestly feel that libraries for the way they are is to be left alone .
