Censorship in libraries should not be allowed .
People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to .
Just becuase one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive .
The libray's need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not .
Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library becuase their children might read it .
If parents are that concerned about what their children see , then they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material .
Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the library's themselves just for having the material .
If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public , then they should be placed in a special area .
This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says ' @CAPS1 content ' and should only be able to be viewed by adults .
This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials .
Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material .
This would also solve a problem becuase it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it .
The best solution to this problem would still allow the library's to put certain material that are found offensive in their library's .
But instead put age restrictions to being able to check out the material and also putting it in a differnet section of the library than the normal material
