Should certain materials such as books , magazines , movies , etc.
, be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others ?
There are many possible answers to this question , but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf .
I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive , there are others who would not find it offensive .
For example , @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion , but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject .
If that book is taken off the shelf , it is restricting other people , such as @PERSON1 , who would like to learn or read about that specific subject .
Another reason why I think that certain books , magazines , music , or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people , then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well .
So , if there are people who find some books offensive , and are then taken away ; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read .
Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people , I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf .
I believe that if someone does not like a certain book , magazine , movie , music , ect.
, that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away .
They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book , and secondly , that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about .
