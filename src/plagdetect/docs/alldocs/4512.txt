Today , millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage .
This can range from exposure to certain movies , music , magazines , books , or to even commercials .
Parents , teachers , and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain .
However is that really the right choice ?
In life , we can not shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face .
In fact , our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world .
This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students ?
When one conceals information , that person is stealing the right of knowledge .
Not only that , but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not .
This topic is just too abstract to be regulated .
For example , take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner , all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us .
Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in
