Every library has tons of information on just about everything .
There are tons of books , music , movies , magazines and more that contain this information .
There is even some information that some people might take offence to .
On the other hand , somebody else could be perfectly fine with it .
I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs , no matter what kind of content they contain , because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books , and it is the same way vice versa .
The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries .
Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race .
Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain , but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about .
Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color , relgion , or ethnic race .
This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today .
Libraries have all kinds of information .
I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain .
Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know
