Have you ever felt that books are offensive ?
Maybe , but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you .
Somepeople think that books , music , movies , and etc .
can be offensive in some way .
I know they can , but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem .
I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries .
From @CAPS1 I hear , people do go angry over things but the question is ' @CAPS1 gets them so angry ? '
@CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others .
For example , a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them .
That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book .
others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds .
Like how in the @NUM1's , some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn , ignorant , human beings .
In my view , actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself , sort of aggrivates me too , but none the less , shouldnt argue because of one major amendment , freedom of speech .
@CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also , like how back in world war @NUM2 , the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short , fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8 .
That can be offensive , and is used usually to talk people over to their side .
I think that if something offends you lightly , most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2 , but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true , maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you .
That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general , not just you .
Then after that the main question we would ask would be ' @CAPS1 should we do next ? '
If I were someone and the book I 'm reading offends me massively , I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2 , and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive , then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs .
Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team , dont tell the library , thats just a waste of time .
Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2 .
I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination , but not over a sports team .
So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending .
Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of .
That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons , not silly one
