What is a library ?
A library is a place you go to that has books , movies , music , magazines , etc .
With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment .
Should there be censorship in libraries ?
In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library .
If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf , there would be nothing left to use in the library .
Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow , imaginate , and dream .
They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book .
However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately .
For example , moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it .
What I 'm trying to say is have censorship in the library , but at a very low standard .
If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library , it would be an empty room .
If someone is offended by something in the library , depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures .
For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is , but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race , ethnicity or something like that , it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf .
Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar .
While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended
