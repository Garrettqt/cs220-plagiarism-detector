Every we go there is censorship .
Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them .
Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do .
It should be up to the children what they read .
Books should be censored if they are made for children .
Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like .
Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also .
We can learn something from any thing we read .
There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can .
When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic .
If they read themselves they would learn alot more .
If your parents do not inform you either , you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life .
It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see .
The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent .
I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines .
These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought , such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model .
Children remember almost everthing they hear/see .
It should be up to the children what they read .
