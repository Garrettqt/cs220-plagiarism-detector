In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music , books , magizines , and etc should be stayed on the shelves .
If they can get illistrated they should be able to be read or listened to .
The things in this paragraph will be about the content of music , books , magizines , and etc .
The music industry too many people think some songs are innapropriate but really that ruins the whole point of the whole entire song .
Maybe it could be age adviced but thats all they should do they should not cut down the content .
The magizines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are illistrated books .
They should be aloud anywere if they got illistrated .
Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theatres , @CAPS1 , or on the @CAPS2 .
From my experience I have seen people complain about these things .
I really do not get why you should complain about these things .
Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries
