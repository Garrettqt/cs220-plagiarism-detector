I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFINSIVE THEN YOU SHOULD N'T READ IT .
CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK , THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK .
MAYBE IT 'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM , MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE .
WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES , SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER .
ABOUT THEIR BOOK .
THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK , ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU .
THAT 'S WHAT I THINK .
ALSO NO I DO N'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN .
THE END .
