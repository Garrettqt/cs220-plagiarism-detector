Every individual has their own opinion on censorship .
Some people believe that , in some instances , it is perfectly fine , but others disagree .
I 'm one person that thinks that , in some instances , things should be censored .
Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read , especially magazines .
Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building .
Schools @MONTH1 not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it .
Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools .
Younger students ' libraries should be monitored even more carefully .
Younger kids , such as elementary age , don't really know what they should and shouldn't read .
In public libraries , things are a little different .
Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out .
Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out .
If the summary is too vague , then they know to read a few pages inside the book .
A couple of times , I 've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense .
When I got home and began reading it , it turned out I was wrong .
The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read .
So , I returned the book to the library .
Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book , but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book .
So , the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out .
Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship .
I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored .
In other instances , things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed to checked out .
