I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library .
But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime .
The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children .
The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area .
If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book .
Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area .
Kids aren ' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them .
Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where , but found in a library is gon na be rare .
The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gon na be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them , and can be found anywhere .
To explain the offensive , and the none offensive books that are out there .
I 'm gon na talk about ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 . '
@CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words , sexual scenes , drugs , gang violence , racism .
@CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it , but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story .
Everything that happened in that book was real , and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things .
Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book .
Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way , but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience .
People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it .
Everything has it's purpose .
The books can tell you the story of peoples life , and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it .
Music can tell you the life of people by poetry .
Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip
