Dear Newspaper ; In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive , because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it .
You are your own person and can make your own decisions , if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone .
Then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something .
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it .
If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it , if there is a magazine that you find offensive , don't read it .
It is as simple as that , people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them .
There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get , where they want it .
From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive , but they don't say anything .
They just ignore it , the world needs more people like that .
More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in .
It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing .
That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life .
Listen to what ever music , read what ever books or magazines that you want .
If someone finds them offensive , so be it .
You are your own person and that won't ever change .
Do what makes you happy and nothing else .
