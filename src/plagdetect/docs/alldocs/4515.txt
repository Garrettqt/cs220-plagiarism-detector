I agree with Katherine's statement , but to a certain extent .
If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it , then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it .
Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school .
Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it .
One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read , and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series .
But as I got into the books , the more mature they got .
In the last book , @ORGANIZATION1 , it has a lot of profanity in it .
But that doesn't mean I 'm not mature enough to not know what it means .
Same with any other high school student .
But you can't protect your children from everything .
Not even curse words .
So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things , and you decide you want it removed , just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her .
I 'm sure they 'll understand .
Or maybe they won't , and they 'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed .
My point is , you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies , or magazines .
But you can always stand your ground and try
