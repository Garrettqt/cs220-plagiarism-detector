When you think of a book do you think happy kids books , or mysterious dark books ?
What if I was to say offensive books ?
Most magazines , music , books , and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @MONTH1 think .
When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy ; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it .
What if you pick a movie that @MONTH1 look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite .
Do you turn it in ?
Do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it ?
Offensive books , movie , music , and magazines should be cleared from the store .
If your not going to finish it , then why is it there ?
Im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good .
If people can sit there and write it , act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not .
People have feelings , if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves .
Do something about it .
We all should have the success for doing something for other people , and if not that then for ourselves .
