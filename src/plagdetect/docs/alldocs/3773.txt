If you are sitting in the librarie and you are minding your doing your homework and studing for a test next hour , I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with.Would you ?
Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries .
Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't .
I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie .
There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive .
Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive .
When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered .
There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them .
But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf .
They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy .
You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids .
They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to .
When I am studying I like to listen to music .
It helps me think what I am going and calms me down .
But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud .
Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries .
Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf .
Another thing that has been a problem is magazines .
There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched .
I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf .
Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people .
If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad
