I think that most books , magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok .
Many people needs to read them and see what they are about .
I think people take little things such as , curse words , or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve .
I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it .
Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is .
I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them .
I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it .
I guess thats just how it is now a days .
You honestly can not find a book without atleast one bad word in it .
People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials .
I do not think that the books , music , movie , magizines etc .
should be removed from the shelves .
It could be interesting to someone else but not you .
Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read , listen or even look at certain kind of reading material .
