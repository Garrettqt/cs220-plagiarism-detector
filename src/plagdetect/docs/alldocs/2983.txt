A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books , music , movies , and Magazines .
I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections , @CAPS1 @CAPS2 , and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3 .
Here's my idea to fix the problem .
I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people , but it might not offend others .
Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people .
The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room .
There could be seperate rooms for children .
It has nothing but children's books , movies , music , and magazines .
Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content .
This brings me to my next topic .
You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content ' room .
I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex , drugs , and alcohol .
The library could get in a lot of trouble .
The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room .
That seems fair enough .
Your old enough to be able to handle the content .
I dont get offended easily , so I can read just about anything .
Like I suggested previously in the article , the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it .
I like reading about anything and everything , so I would love to read things and spark my attention .
Books like that usually deal with bad things .
I 'm okay with that , but I understand that others are not .
Seperate rooms , @CAPS1 limits , and my views are all good ideas .
Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said .
I think that will be very affective .
I hope to start seeing that in the future
