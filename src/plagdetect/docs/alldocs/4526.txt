' Everyone in the world has an opinion , some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading , listening , and watching the material .
I personally have never had this kind of problem , i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies .
there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music , but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing .
I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to .
some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral .
Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines .
Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull , it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children .
Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson , The @CAPS1 , and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly , and old smooth positive rap , good old country music , and nice soothing jazz .
The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds .
I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things . '
