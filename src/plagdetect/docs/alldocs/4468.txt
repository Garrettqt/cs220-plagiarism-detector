Everyone has an opinion .
Don't you agree ?
That's what makes us different , this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2 , or why some want to listen to pop instead of country .
A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together .
It's a place of interest and information , a place for research and enjoyment .
So here is my question : 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive .
'
?
I don't believe so , as the quote says by the author , Katherine Paterson , 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
I agree with that statement !
Think about this , if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like , if everyone had that right .
We would have no more books , no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I 've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with , but other people might .
You can't just have a library all to yourself .
Something for just your interests and nobody elses .
That's not what a library is for , millions of people use libraries for different purposes .
So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves .
Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that .
We all have rights just like we all have likes , dislikes , and minds of our own.Opinions define us , choices shape us , but libraries do so much more , they advance our knowledge , make our dreams a reality , and sometimes even broaden our horizons .
We need books , music , movies , and even magazines , but we need them all together .
That's my position on this topic , I hope this helped form yours .
