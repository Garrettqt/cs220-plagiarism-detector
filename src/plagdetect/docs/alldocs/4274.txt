Censorship has been around for awhile and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like telivision , books , magazines , almost about everything .
Some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens .
There not little kids and they shouldn't have things censored .
Like when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie .
For little kids I think that they should have things censored because there young .
They just dont need to be hearing bad language and anything .
Parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young .
Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with there teachers if they say it .
It seems like the younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think its sad because they shouldn't be around that .
They pick up alot of stuff when there young so your like a role model for them .
I believe that older teens like @NUM1 and @NUM2 are more mature about this , if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word .
Im sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when your in town .
They going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it .
Books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing .
You can't just throw out books or censor them .
Everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion .
When you get at a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored
