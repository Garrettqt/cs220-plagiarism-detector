The material we read in books are sometimes offensive .
Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them .
I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads .
I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing .
The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine , cellular phone , iPod or using a computer .
I believe magazines are worse than any book .
Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends .
Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band , singer or rapper , whatever .
Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics .
Then people get pulled in .
Music doesn't have rating were movies do .
Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what .
This is were the internet comes into play .
Most people have acsess to a computer .
Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see .
Internet is also use to educate .
The internet also opens up the doors to video games .
Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom .
They also play with complete stranger .
Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music , magazines , music , ect .. , that send a bad message .
No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see .
The only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet .
Even if we do this there could always still be away .
