A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading .
There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries .
We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas .
Certain materail @MONTH1 be offensive to different people , but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading , would not be fair .
If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion , then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information .
Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed ?
If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world .
How do you think that author would feel ?
You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive .
How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries can not put this on their shelfs because its offensive .
There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people , but that is the media that writes the society as we read it .
Some of those people @MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things .
Maybe not even watch certain materials but others , that might be there part of livlyhood .
We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries .
That material is the life blood of our society .
If you cut the blood flow , bad things are bound to happen after that .
For whoever reads this , remember what we produces as media is who we are , what we do , and what we live for .
