I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries , children don't really know what those offensive things mean.The library is the only good place to find information or to find a book that they enjoy .
If you take things that @MONTH1 seem offensive to people ; people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they neeed .
People use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way .
The library doesn't intentionally insult people .
The library just gives us facts about what we need to know about a person or anything like that .
Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that and if they cant be mature about stuff like that then they don't need to be in the library .
I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone but their not so why should the magazines , movies , books , an music be taken out of the library .
Thats just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information .
Slavery is an offensive thing to colored people cause the colored people get called names that i will not say in this essay .
Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past .
Honestly I think people will be ok they dont need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive they just need to know that it wasnt intentionaly done
