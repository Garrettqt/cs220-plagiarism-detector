Library books offensive ?
The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us , people , per our opinions .
If someone has an issue with the book ; next time don't get it .
I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys .
It's not up to us to make that choice .
I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys ' , but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend .
I have had problems with this before .
I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about : honestly its her opinion .
A person should have a right to his/her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses .
One person @MONTH1 really like the book and someone else @MONTH1 hate it , obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it .
The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian .
That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library .
If it includes something graphic or racist , you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation , because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library .
Some items can be offensive to some but not others .
The library is there for knowledge and entertainment .
We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal because their could be reasons why things are where they are .
You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter/ who is in charge of the library
