Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself , 'hey , this book looks pretty good . '
But once you read @CAPS3 , you deamed @CAPS3 as innoproprate for younger people ?
I have , but unlike some people , I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries .
I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place .
Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions , and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books , a band's songs , or a magazine's articles .
This brings me to say that books , music , magazines , newspapers , etc .
should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries .
Just because some people do not like the content that they hold , doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others .
I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice , like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1 .
There are too many options , like when @CAPS3 comes to the books , movies , music , and magazines .
If something strikes you as innoproprate , then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better .
One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old .
My mother took me into the library and I found a book , ' A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 . '
I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library .
Only this time , she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out .
She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time , she wanted me to wait untill I was older .
@CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very innoproprate book for my age , at the time .
But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries , asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them .
Other mothers and fathers are the same way , as I found out .
My best friend's parents had been the same way with her .
Only instead of a book , @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to .
They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad ' for her to hear .
They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3 .
They did not blame the library .
If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3 , or have their childen listen to @CAPS3 , then @CAPS3 was their own personal choice .
I do not belive that libraries should have censorships .
They can have different sections , such as adult , children , and young adult .
But I believe that they should not have to take books , music , magazines , etc .
off the shelves just because of certain people .
@CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice .
If they do not like the item that they picked up , they should take responsibility for their actions , and not blame others for their mistakes .
