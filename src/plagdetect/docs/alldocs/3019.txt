From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries .
The main reason is because of the books , magazines , ariticles , and internet that contains content very disturbing for children .
Such content requires material as violence , drugs , and nudity .
In this argument , parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content .
Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to .
Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves .
That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid ' in school .
They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs , violence , or nudity .
But if the libraries have censored content in the library , then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content .
In the parents thoughts , uncensored content should be kept away from children .
The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves .
They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library .
They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children .
It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material .
Their are parents who have kids in school , who do not care about what they learn or what they do .
Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday .
Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content .
Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to .
Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child .
The falt goes to the parents and the libraries .
They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at
