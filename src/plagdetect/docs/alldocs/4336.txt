I dont believe that we should sencor or take away any thing off of out library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriet for veiwers , but I wouldent recomend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material untill they are at the age of where they are ready for that sort of viewing .
The reason why I say this is because that I believe and know that people sooner or later are going tho see , hear , and go through that sort of that viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives , it has happend to many people and it will continue to happen to everyone in their lives .
The events that happen to many people are awful but yet are true , @CAPS1 that go around in the world should be known to other people and why , so people can know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do , we should know how to go-by when some cerntian events go through like an example ; if a cerntian person of race and is minding his own bisnuess passes a group of race appressers and they began offending him by words then he shouldent worry .
Because if a person is only going to constantly use words then you should know that he/she is just a weak person just trying to get on your nervs and wont do any physical harm to you .
There are many @CAPS1 that people dont like and try their best to hide it from others , but that would only make @CAPS1 worse for everybody and would lead them clueless if some people got exposed to what some people attend to hide ; We shouldent hide @CAPS1 from others and keep them from not knowing what has happend or what is going on and leaving them clueless .
I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on , no matter how crule or painful it is , they should know what it is and how to take care of them selves when thell experience it at first hand .
