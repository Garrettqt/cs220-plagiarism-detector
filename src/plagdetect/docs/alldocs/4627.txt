I do believe that certain books , music , movies , and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries , if they are found to be offensive .
We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read .
If the media is offensive , than someone's feelings will get hurt .
I remember a time when I read a book , and it had some really offensive things about homeless people .
I felt bad just for reading this , because it just made them sound like horrible people .
Which in a lot of cases isn't true , but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it .
Those people now rudely look down on them .
So why would we allow this book to be in the library ?
This book changes the way many people think , and so do many more books .
There is a lot of offensive music too .
Today most of the songs people listen to are , but we just don't realize it .
These should not be available in a library , cause anybody could rent them .
Which isn't good , cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay .
Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines .
Most magazines are okay , but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories .
So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all .
The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay , or not are definately movies .
They need to realize that kids could rent these , and think are they apporiate .
I think libraries should only have family oriented movies .
This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw .
In conclusion , libraries should be extra careful in their media choices .
They need to try and limit everything that is offensive , to try stop anybody from getting harmed
