I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library .
It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it .
On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1 .
Kids fifteen and and older would understand .
They might also have to have an adult with them .
On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys .
It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like .
There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not .
It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties .
It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description .
The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though .
I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are .
I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law .
Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them .
