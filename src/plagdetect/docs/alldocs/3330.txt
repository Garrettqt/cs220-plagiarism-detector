Eventually , everyone sees or hears offensive things .
However , the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it .
They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids .
But , if kids are introduced early , we would not have to keep it a secret anymore .
Libraries and all types of media should not be censored .
Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from ? '
and adults , wanting to avoid an awkward conversation , make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth .
Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want .
Yes , at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school .
More kids would be educated , so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff .
That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television .
It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news , they report the whole truth .
They have freedom of speech , and we have a right to know .
At first , people would think it was a terrible world .
But , eventually , with right leadership , it would help make a more truthful environment .
Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school , and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any .
Drug use and rape would go down .
Then , talking about 'offensive ' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions .
This would change the world for the better .
