I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive .
The way i look at it is , is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions .
Not everyone is going to think alike .
As an example some people are against blacks and others are not .
Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore , they should all be able to listen to whatever .
Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do .
Don't read it if it offends you , but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it .
