I believe that they should leave leave them on the shelves .
I think people take stuff like that to serious , if they dont like it I think they should just leave it alone.What some people might find offensive others will find interesting .
There is alot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people , but if they dont like it all they have to do is put it up and go on with there life like its no big deal .
In the past there has been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past .
Stuff like that I can understand because that can be personal reasons .
There has also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing.Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way.There is still alot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complains about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race .
I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with , what they did @TIME1 , or even who has the best body and who has the worse body.I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about theirself and we wouldnt have so many problems .
