My views on censorship , I don't belive in any type of censorship .
Books , music , and movies shouldn not be censored .
When it comes to children , it should be the parent's responsability to choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read , watch , or listen to .
Taking books , movies , and music off selves isn't fair to thoose who want to read , watch , or listen to them or to the authors , directors , or musicions .
People should have the freedom to write whatever they want , the reader dosen't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying , but it is his freedom to say it
