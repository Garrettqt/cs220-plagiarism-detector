Yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human etc .
but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gon na learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good .
Really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them .
