I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1 .
I think its wrong to do so , because any book should be read know matter what is said in it .
Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone .
Now ive not really seen anything that i 'd fine offensive , but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see .
But nothing that i found offensive personally .
Books are there for their own purpose , and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it .
