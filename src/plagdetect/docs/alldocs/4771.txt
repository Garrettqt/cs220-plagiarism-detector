We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read .
Children don't know any better .
But why should we have to have movies , books and etc censored , cause their little children every where .
If i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would .
I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelfs .
If everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch .
Having everything censored thats just not fair to the world .
Everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored .
If people favorite movies or music was censored it probably wouldnt be that funny to them anymore , they 'll most likely just stop watching it .
I don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries .
Certain materials in like cd's songs do come off little offensive sometimes , but that's just life .
If you think it's offensive then just don't listen to it .
That doesnt mean that they have to take it off the shelf .
Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc .
That doesnt mean they have a right just to take it off cause of that .
If they did that's just really unfair .
Children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know , for an example cursing .
If a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine .
The parent shouldnt really be mad and take that offensive , and think that not suppose to be in their .
The library shouldn't have to censor thing's cause of that incident .
The children will hear it or see it again soon or later .
I would keep the right for the libraires to have things uncensored , if i had the decision .
Those are some ideas why i think they shouldnt have to censor movies , music etc in the library .
