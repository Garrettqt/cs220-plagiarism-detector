Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would like to talk to you about .
I have been hearing alot of people talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot of information inside of them and if we started taking information out of them then what would be the point in having them .
I think that everything in libraries are very important and who is to know that everybody wants this to happen .
The one thing that I dont really think that libraries need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much .
And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say even if it is hurtfull .
Though I think that the more people read about what people are saying about them is the less that they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used to it that they are not even goin to know what they are talking about .
If there was one thing that I could tel the world it would be dont be offened by what people say to you .
