i think that if there are offensive books , music , magazines , etc then they should be put in a section of their own , or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs/wants them then they would have to go to the front dest in order to get them .
i think also , if a young child or teenager cant see , read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period
