I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf .
They are certain books , music , movies , magazines that people find quite offensive .
There could be a few books that have some aweful material in it .
The pictures in magazines , on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people @MONTH1 find really offensive .
I have never actually seen anything like that before , but it does happen in schools all aroung the world .
People might not get what certain materials want you to do , but they @MONTH1 get offended and tell someone about it .
They would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material .
Certain materials should be removed from the shelves .
