I believe books , music , movies , magazines , and etc .
should be removed from the lilbrary if they are offensive .
Some peole take things wrong and lilbraries could have issuses .
Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily .
Lastly , it might let someone feel better about themselves .
First , some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses .
If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite .
Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them .
It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people .
Second , it keeps customers happy .
If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them .
If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed .
The more people feel home bond the more they will come .
Next , it might let someone feel better .
If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too .
If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted .
Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary , then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock .
In @CAPS1 , there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict .
You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back , but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it .
somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin .
So before you make your decision thing would you want it done to you
