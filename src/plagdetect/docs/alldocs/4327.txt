I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out .
Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad .
If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1 .
I have read some books that are really good , but kids shouldn't read them .
I read this book @CAPS3 ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ' and @CAPS4 is really sad .
@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little .
I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad , but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4 .
Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v .
because they think that they are bad .
I was watching this t.v .
show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do .
I 'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch .
I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell .
Some movies are better if they have bad things in them , @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes .
I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie .
I watched them before though
