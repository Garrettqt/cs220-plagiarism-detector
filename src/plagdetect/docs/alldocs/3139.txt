Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self .
I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it !
Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and absolutly hate it !
The last book I checked out , even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out , had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine .
Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs .
I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is !
Let alone read about it in school !
maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age .
The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed .
what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs ?
Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex .
They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are , what kind of high it 'll give you .
And were you can buy the crap to make them !
Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines .
The book i read have pictures of postions in it !
it broke everything down into details !
It even gave websites on the back of the book .
And that my friends is not alright .
Its just sad .
It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading .
Doesn't it scare you ?
I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail .
Let alont them reading about it at all .
just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs .
Hardly anyone will read them anyway .
And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where
