Censorship can be considered as a major problem .
I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want .
It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and can not read , listen to , or even watch .
Lastly , censorship is a popular communist trend .
Therefore , I believe censorship is wrong .
First of all , we have a right to say , read , write , and watch what we want , as long as it is not slandering someone .
I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today .
So , in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral .
Second , it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored .
My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses .
If they think it should be censored , they shouldn't read it themselves .
Others @MONTH1 find the book , movie , or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting .
Lastly , censorship is a communist trend .
Last I checked , the @LOCATION1 is a democracy .
So , it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race .
So , censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere .
It is a very communist thing to do .
It infringes our rights .
Lastly , opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored
