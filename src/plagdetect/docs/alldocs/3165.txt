Dear @CAPS1 , @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 .
I am a student here at @LOCATION1 , and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library .
I think this is wrong .
If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away , we would be left with no books to read .
I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read .
I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading .
If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then , why does that concern you ?
Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to .
Also , I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting .
If you take every offensive word out of a book , chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it .
If you take all offensive books from the library , kids will be even more discouraged about reading , and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do .
If you think that books are that offensive , try walking down the hallways .
this is a @ORGANIZATION1 .
Kids cuss all the time , and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I 've ever read .
If your looking to make children more innocent , then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it
