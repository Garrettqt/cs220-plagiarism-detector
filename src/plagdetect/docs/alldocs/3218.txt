I believe that certain books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
shouldn't be removed from the shelves .
I say this because , what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another .
There are many different types of books , movies and even some music that have some history to it , it @MONTH1 be offensive , but to some certain race or culture it's history .
What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa .
If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it .
Katherine said , 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive ' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left .
A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs , but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all .
Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools , censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries .
If censoring did happen in public libraries , I 'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring .
People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man , well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did , I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself .
A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today , like gangs , if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members ?
this is why I believc we shouldn't take books , magazines , movies , etc .
off of the shelves
