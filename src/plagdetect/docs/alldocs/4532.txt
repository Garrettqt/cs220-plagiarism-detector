There are books up and down the shelves in the library that @MONTH1 make people wonder @CAPS1 they are up there .
People @MONTH1 stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves , ' @CAPS1 in the world is this book here ? '
@CAPS2 many people @MONTH1 not know is that every book is in the world for a reason .
Books published are in the world to teach about history , manners , literature , or they could be made to take you on an advantage .
Of course you @MONTH1 come across a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to someone , maybe even yourself , but it is there for a reason .
I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery .
It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner .
Now some people would have been very offended by this book , because the @CAPS3 were calling the @CAPS4 all those names that the @CAPS4 do not like to be called .
But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people .
People can go to any library , from one in an elementary school to a public library , and you will always find at least one book about the @CAPS6 .
Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books , because nobody liked or does like @CAPS7 , but they have to be there because of history .
People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people .
That would be like taking the @CAPS6 out of history , and that just can not happen .
If it happened , it happened , and people have to know .
Whether people admit it or not , they have ran into at least one book that has offended them .
That will happen , it is almost natural for it to happen .
But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf .
Those people know that books teach us , and we need books to know @CAPS2 is possible , @CAPS2 happened , and @CAPS2 might happen .
Books are here for a reason , and they need to stay
