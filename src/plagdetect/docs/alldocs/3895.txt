The things we find in libararies shouldn't be offensive to anybody .
It's the choice you make rather you won't to read it or not .
Nobody is making look at those things if you don't want to .
Don't look at it , if you think it's offensive .
The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves .
Some people like looking or reading things like that .
People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like .
If that was to happen , then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library , I bet you can find something offensive about it .
People find stuff like that entertaning when watch or read stuff like that .
That hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like thats what people wan't to see .
True enough thats what people won't see as long as it's not effecting them in no kind of way .
That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things , so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have on problem reading or watching a book about it .
I see stuff offensive on tv about everyday , but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that , I woudn't care because i 'm use to seeing it on tv .
Nobody can make read or stop reading things like that , only you can .
You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive .
It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because thats what we hear and see everyday .
No matter what some people find that entertaning .
