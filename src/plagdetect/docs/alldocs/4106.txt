Read , @CAPS1 , and @CAPS2 ?
Books , music , and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them .
In our spare time , we all enjoy to read , @CAPS1 , and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so .
These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare .
The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything , but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library .
People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out , but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it .
Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies .
And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening , reading or watching .
Genre comes in all kind of different types .
For example , theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only .
Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out , it should be kept from a childs hand or vision .
Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand .
All readings , music , or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library .
In this case , nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else .
Honestly all media actually should have their own section .
For example , all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section .
All books should be left on the shelves of every library , only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read .
A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand , an adult has their own type of selection .
So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self , that also goes for , movies , music , or any other media
