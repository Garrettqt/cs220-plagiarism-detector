I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are to vaulger to young children .
like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves .
they should only be aloud to put @NUM1 stuff on the shelves .
i think that they shouldnt even makes books or magazines like that unless they can keep them hid from people under the age of @NUM2 .
but people are gon na do what they want to do .
thats all i have to say .
have a nice day .
