I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf .
You should know what your picking up .
If you think it might be offensive to you , then set it back on the shelf .
It's as easy as that .
Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for .
Censorship in libraries is just uneeded .
Everyone should be able to take care of themselves .
Read the title before you pick up the book .
It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you .
Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child .
Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else .
Not everyone is offended by the same material .
For some it @MONTH1 be pictures .
For others it could just be words .
But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world .
It just can not be avoided .
So why take it out of libraries .
If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book .
It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book .
It will benefit both sides of this argument .
People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended .
But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them .
Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book .
You should have an idea of what your picking up .
Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article , why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them .
Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life .
So why have censorship in libraries .
It's not accomplishing anything .
