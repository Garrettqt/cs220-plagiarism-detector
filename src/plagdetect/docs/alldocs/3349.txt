There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today .
I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves .
People have a right to read what they choose to read .
There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library .
First of all , there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive . '
@CAPS1 removing all of these offending books , you would basically be removing half the books in the library .
Most young adult books have something to do with teens , drugs , violence , and other things that would come off as offensive .
These books are usually the ones that teenagers read .
Just because they 're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected .
These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody .
Secondly , I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read , listen to , and watch .
Books , music , movies , and magazines are sold for this purpose .
Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike .
Finally , I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake .
There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known .
Children wouldn't know about them , and they could be missing out on some great stories .
Everyone has an opinion , and watching out for your children is understandable .
Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people .
Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste .
