Libraries in @LOCATION1 I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book .
I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf , because some people have different views over the book or magazine .
So I am going to tell what I think over this subject .
I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something , because some people might find it interesting .
People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others .
For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them , and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also .
Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others .
Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf .
So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others .
So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive .
So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them
