No , cause if that is the case evry book you read could be offense to somebody .
If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama .
Third reason every could be offense to somebody .
First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them , for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world .
I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last .
Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama .
They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author .
Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary .
Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book .
