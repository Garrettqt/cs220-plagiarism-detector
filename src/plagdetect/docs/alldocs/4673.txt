Do you think we should have censorship in our libraries ?
I say no because if we had censorship then there would be very few good books , magazines , and movies because in this world today everyone gets ofended by something .
For example in action , horror , and comedy films there could be blood , violains , and cursing .
which some times make a moive good.Even in some book there is cureing and violains .
Some @MONTH1 even seem provocative .
For example in @ORGANIZATION1 the book repedaly use the n word.Even same magazines like fasion , sports , and same car magazine are seen aas provocative .
An if I walked in to my local libray and seen all my favorite movies , books , and magazine not on the self i would never go back again .
Im not trying to say put adult books in the elementry school libray .
but in the public libray its ok ot have book like that .
Could you amagine a libray with cenrsorship ?
It would empty .
