Everday hundreds of people visit your local library .
The library offers and array of things such as books , music , movies , magazines and newspapers , but what 'limits ' does the library have about the content of those things ?
All sorts of people go to the library .
I go to the library , you go to the library , moms , dads , aunts , uncles , siblings , we all go to the library at one time in our life .
Different crowds of people have different interests that @MONTH1 offend others .
The question is , should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries ?
Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them .
Truth is , someone , somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries ; you can never please everyone .
Also , some of these topics could be used for educational purposes .
Take anatomy books for example .
While high school and college srtudents use these books and diagrams to study , some mothers many find them inappropriate for their young children to see .
This is why libraries have seperate sections for different audiences .
There could be a childrens section , a 'tween ' section , and an adult section to help with this issue .
Also , everyone has different interests .
I , personally , can not stand rap music but my sister loves it .
Eventhough I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not .
The song writers , singers , publishers , and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so .
Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex , drugs or murduer because , face it , those things are part of our day to day lives .
If children aren't seeing these things in libraries , they will eventually come across them else where .
Should we remove 'offensive ' material from libraries ?
No .
If we do that there will be no books to read , no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to sometyhing .
