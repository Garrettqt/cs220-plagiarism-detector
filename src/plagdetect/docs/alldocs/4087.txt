Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive .
People argue to get the corruptive books , magazines , movies off the shelves .
The customers have the choice not to check out the material , it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf .
People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not , if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it .
The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason , and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it .
Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion , or just the way those people view things , but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf .
Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books .
Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's .
Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody .
Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive .
If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate .
The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back , that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed .
Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library .
Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read .
When looking for a book , magazine , movie , etc.
, and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day , it's as simple as that
