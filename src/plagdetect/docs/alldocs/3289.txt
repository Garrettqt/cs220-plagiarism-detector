In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library .
I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing .
In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests .
At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library , beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern .
If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad .
I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things .
There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area , and others are in another area .
We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area .
If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming .
In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books , people would get mad and not come to the library .
If that happens smaller amounts of people will come .
In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people have many interesting in many topics in the library .
If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people .
Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library .
Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library .
