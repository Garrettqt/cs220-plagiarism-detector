The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do .
My view on the subject is that , if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country .
Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left .
We use books everyday , for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses .
Books help us learn things , like new words we 've never heard of before , or some major point in history we should know about .
Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time .
I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf , just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate .
If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section .
their is a problem for this idea , what books should go into this section of the library ?
A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation .
This idea goes the same for everything found at a library .
Another soulution to this matter is that , the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both .
this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book , or what happend during the book .
This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so .
The books , music , magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason .
Sombody wrote , or composed for a reason .
so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music
