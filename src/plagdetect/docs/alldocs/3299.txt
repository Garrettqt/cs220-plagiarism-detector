Many libraries contain books , movies , music , and magazines that can be considered offensive .
All of these libraries , however , have certain reasons to have these books .
Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation , the libraries have reasons for them .
So , the libraries that do have 'offensive ' books , should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone , and they could be beneficial to the reader .
These books that are considered offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be offensive to others .
For example , @PERSON2 , who is from the @CAPS1 , comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , and she reads that the @CAPS1 is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves .
@PERSON2 gets a @CAPS5 offended by this .
Then @CAPS5 @PERSON3 , who is an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 , picks up the same book and reads all about the @CAPS1 and how they treated their slaves .
@CAPS5 @PERSON3 thinks that the same book that @PERSON2 hated is a great book .
As shown in the example , @LOCATION2's people are very diverse , but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens .
A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race , it wants to appeal to all of them , the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process .
The citizens of the @LOCATION1 need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here .
If a book offends a person , that person simply should not read it .
However , these books , who many @MONTH1 find offensive , could also be beneficial to its readers .
Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it .
Going back to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reference , @PERSON2 was reading her @LOCATION3 @CAPS11 text book , and she read about the horrible deeds the @CAPS1 had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the @CAPS3 to the @ORGANIZATION1 , and she got offended because her side lost .
Then @CAPS5 @PERSON4 , who is in the same class as @PERSON2 , was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on .
He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the @ORGANIZATION1 defeated the @CAPS1 .
@PERSON3 was as happy as he could be with this book , whereas @PERSON2 couldn't be any more displeased .
If this book was pitched out of the library , how would students all over the nation learn of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ?
They wouldn't .
Libraries can not just throw out books because they offend someone .
As Katherine Paterson said , if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them , then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one , and so on and so forth .
So , libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books .
This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to .
We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't .
