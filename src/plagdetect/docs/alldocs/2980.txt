Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves ?
People have different oppions , of whats good and whats bad .
I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time .
I hear people telling me , 'oh dont read that book its a bad book .
'But I ask myself , @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance ? '
@CAPS1 are some books , music , movies , and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive .
Yet we still want to read , listen , watch , and look at them .
If we tried to remove all the offensive books , from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves .
Katherine Paterson said , 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote .
Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive ?
Ask yourself the question again , ' @CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance ? '
@CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear .
