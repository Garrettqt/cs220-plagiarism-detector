I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries .
Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see , hear , and read certain things .
If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material , movies , or music they can do that elsewhere .
Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not .
Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable .
They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers .
Other material , however , most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that .
People that wish to view , listen to , or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere .
People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children .
I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library .
Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place ?
Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library .
I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about .
The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it .
