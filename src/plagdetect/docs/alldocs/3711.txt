I agree and disagree with the prompt .
I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf , listen to any music , watch all types of movies , or read any type of magazine .
Then I think it isn't okay .
First , reason for agreeing is because some books , music , movies , magazines , and etc .
@MONTH1 not be suitable for most young children .
They @MONTH1 use profanity , show naked pictures , or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age .
Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing .
Also , adults @MONTH1 use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library .
So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive .
Then , on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books , movies , music , or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off .
I say this because if a child does not be experienced to what could happened if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing , or go on watching adult movies .
So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age .
I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permenantly .
In conclusion , I think that this could go both ways .
But , the books , movies , music , or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be move to a certain area in the library
