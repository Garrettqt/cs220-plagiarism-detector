This writing is socially unacceptable !
There are many books and media sources , that include : lauguage , sexual tones , and other immoral things and ideas .
However culture does need to be obtained , although immorally on this earth is at an all-time high , we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the sheves and turn our attention to people's hearts , and turn to morally right things .
When a person walks into a library , @CAPS8 or she can expect certain things , for example : the smell of the older books , the noise of a group of kids , and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet.What @CAPS8 or she would not expect is : kids doing drugs , and watching porn on the computers .
This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers ' fault .
This is the fault of an immoral world .
I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worst everyday , there is good , but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet .
I can quote from many , in my @NUM1 grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong , is telling someone they are ' .
This thought process is immoral .
But who is going to tell them that , and what is the answer .
@CAPS2 is the answer , in the @CAPS1 it says , @CAPS2 is the way , the truth , and the life.This is truth .
In the book of @CAPS3 it says , @CAPS4 gave many people over to their sinful passions .
@CAPS4 is the only good , and the only light comes from @CAPS5 .
The only man to live a perfect life was @CAPS2 @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 was @CAPS4 in a human body .
we as a planet need to turn to @CAPS5 , the only good thing .
And try to be like @CAPS5 , because this world needs @CAPS5 .
Only @CAPS4 can change a heart .
We need the focus on @CAPS5 , once we do that , the way we think , and the way we write , and the way we act , will change and we will not need to disgust this problem any longer
