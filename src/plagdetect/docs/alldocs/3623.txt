I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored .
Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes .
On the other hand , there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it .
Take for example a book about @PERSON1 .
It could have some things in it that people could find offensive .
But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1 , it would be best to have as much information on him as possible .
I will make one compromise : if there is music being checked out with offensive language , they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album .
There are ways that censorship can be good , and some ways that it could be bad .
Some people find bad language and themes offensive , while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author .
I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all
