I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library .
Yes there are some very offincive items in a library , such as a book about racism to african americans .
No , that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all .
The library is open to any and or everybody .
Lets suppose you have a young child , and you take him/her to the public library with you .
As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach , pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open .
You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child .
Thats your own fault , not the librarys .
Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at , you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking .
I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material ' should be kept .
And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification , and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around .
And that is my view on this subject .
