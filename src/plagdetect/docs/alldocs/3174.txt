I do believe that some places have magizines , books , movies , and music that need to be removed from all shelfs .
Just think , if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it .
Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores , but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want , and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence .
Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it ?
Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores , its not nessacary .
Same deal goes with movies , say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it , do want that around your kids ?
i know i wouldnt , cause kids are like monkeys , monkey see monkey do , and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you .
I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents , and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer , tv or movies .
So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone , of many ages to see ?
It's not .
Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed , cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else , its gross , nasty , and inrepropriet to childern .
I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor
