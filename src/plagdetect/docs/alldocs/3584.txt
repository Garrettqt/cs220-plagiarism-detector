TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2 Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life .
The author can not filter through the entire book to remove offensive language , racial remarks , slurs , etc .
One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another .
I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group , person , or community .
Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre .
The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories , so they will not be offended .
Maturity comes with understanding .
Books are sorted by genre .
Most , to all , times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre .
The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor .
When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration .
If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day .
The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so .
From one reader to another , taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution .
Maturity comes with understanding .
If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child .
This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person , group , or community
