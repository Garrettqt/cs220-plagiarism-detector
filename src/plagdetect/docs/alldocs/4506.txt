Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years .
In many school libraries certain books , music , movies , and magazines have been removed because of the content in them .
These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include , use of violence , sexual acts , drug use , and inapropriate language .
Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school .
Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age , because it could influence them to participate in these activities .
In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups .
Inn elementry and middle school libraries , items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway .
In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use , and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them , rather than hearing about drugs , sex , and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie .
Many kids watch movies that have very violent , and inapropriate scenes , and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids .
Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them , this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing .
