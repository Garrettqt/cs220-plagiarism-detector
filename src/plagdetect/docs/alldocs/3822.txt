Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere , however , you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place .
With a simple library card , children could check out a boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn .
But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time .
The answer to this problem is strict censorship .
Books are big , powerful , and a vast amount of information .
Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood , the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out .
Most of the time , only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through .
This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life .
Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem .
The fact is , even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection , this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home .
The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive , easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands .
Libraries are great for research or school projects , but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids .
Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material
