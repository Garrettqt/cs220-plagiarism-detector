People all around the world think differently about music , books , and movies .
Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings .
Some people think that a song should be rated ' @CAPS1 ' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all .
Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for .
Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into .
If everyone could pull off a book or magazine , etc then there would be no books left .
This is why we have levels of maturty on the material .
Levels are letters , such as ' @CAPS1 ' for mature .
'
@CAPS1 ' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song .
With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away .
This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear .
Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie .
Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act , language , and blood .
It can stand for more things such as drugs .
I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie , but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it , then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it .
We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too .
We could try getting rid of all bad books , movies etc , but over time I ' @CAPS1 sure more will be made .
I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website .
We can not save our kids their whole life , so over time we have got to let them grow up .
Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch .
We just have to raise them the best we can .
