What is consitered offensive ?
If we took books , music , movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left .
Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways .
By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world .
Things we learn about in school , slavery , wars and some pollitics .
Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world .
What about drugs and alchol , many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances , so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body .
Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive .
So who is to say what offends people and what does not ?
If thats the case shouldn't we take all books , movies , music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries ?
Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper .
By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books , no local news , no movies , no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive .
Everyone has the right to read and write what they want .
No one can say what offends everyone .
Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race , another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat .
Everyone looks at everythings diffrently .
So why try and control us all as one .
All people think diffrent and they know what they want to read , hear and watch all by them selfs , they don't need someone to tell them .
