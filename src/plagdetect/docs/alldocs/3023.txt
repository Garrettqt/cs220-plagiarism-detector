Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think about removing certain materials such as books , music , movies , and-or magazines is that it should be your choice .
I always thought that was part of our constitutional right .
I read alot of urban books because that's @CAPS2 I enjoy .
They realae towhere I have been , or where I @MONTH1 be going in my life .
No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern , but they @MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies .
You @MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them .
There are alot of books , and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned .
If everyone started @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they don't like , there wouldn't be any need for movies , libraries , or book stores .
Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from .
@CAPS2's bad to you @MONTH1 not be bad to me , or the next person .
When you go into a library , or book store , you already have and idea of @CAPS2 you are looking for .
If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids , they should have their own section that reads , 'For @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ' .
We are the @CAPS3 and parents .
We should be the one's in control of our kids and @CAPS2 they read and watch .
I don't think @CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days , if they want them bad enough , will figure out away to read or watch them anyway .
