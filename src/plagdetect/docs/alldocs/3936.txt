I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books .
Also the little kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that .
The bigger kids like in grades @NUM1 should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before .
The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries , like the books thatis called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times , a other one is @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f , s , and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age .
Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home .
If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades @NUM2 becaues the that the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read .
Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books .
Why should the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are .
The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom , dad , grandme , grandpa , and ect .
