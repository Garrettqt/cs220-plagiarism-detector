Censorships in the libraris would be liked cutting the worlds air supply .
It would be taking away from a readers imagintion .
stoping readers from being able to express their mind .
My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed .
Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels .
By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed .
Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone .
Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries .
Books were made to keeping people wondering , learning , and excited .
By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds .
More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher .
Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress .
People minds would not be wondering , learning or being kept excited .
I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library .
I was in the library looking for a book .
I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out .
The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back .
Then i was able to check a book out .
So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries .
That would be tking away from a librarains job .
So dont take away readrs imagintion
