Do you believe that certain materials ; books , music , movies , and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people ?
Accordingly , I do not believe this way .
If we were to take books off a shelf for everyone who thought it was offensive , we wouldn't have any books left on the shelf .
According to my prior knowledge , I know certain materials will affect different people in different ways .
I have had my own experience when in svhool .
Some people do not want to say the pledge due to saying 'one nation , under @CAPS1 . '
We all have various opinions on subjects ; so we all will react differntly .
However , that doesn't mean we should take away something he or she finds offensive ; others find it appropriate .
Observing others when in offensive situations @MONTH1 help find a solution to these problems .
The solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity .
Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation .
Materials that fit under one catagory should be put in one section .
Often times , this seperation helps people find what they need and not be offended .
In our own constitution it states that all @CAPS2 are free ; freedom of speech in particular .
All materials are written by someone with an opinion so by taking their books off the shelf , we are taking their freedom of speech away .
It is how they express themselves .
If someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it .
Removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers .
It is plain and simple : We shouldn't remove certain materials due to someone finding it offensive .
Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation , not people getting offended easily .
It's based on choices .
People should get to choice what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them .
So now what do you believe ; Should certain materials be removed
