Books are part of history no book should be censored .
They show and teach us about history .
If the book is based on true events nothing should be censored .
Many books from the @DATE1's and earlier have words that younger children should not see yet .
With how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something .
Its just like saying all websites should be cenerosed .
A book that needs to be censored should not be in an @CAPS1 school .
I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it .
This is why a teacher needs to read the book before assigning it the students .
If he/she thinks the students will not act apporiate , then the book should not be used in the class room .
A lot of books would be removed or cenersored from shelves .
If you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book .
Many people would be made mad if this did happen .
I would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad .
Many people are mad now , but everyone else would be mad if censerorship happened
