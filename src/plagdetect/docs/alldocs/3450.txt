While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth , those who do not learn from history , are doomed to repeat it .
That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly .
Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1 ' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs , teaches you how to use firearms etc .
this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look .
This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach .
Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good , thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone .
One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves .
He sent men , women , and childeren to his many death camps and work camps .
One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or ' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ' .
Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's .
This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 .
But if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands .
All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books
