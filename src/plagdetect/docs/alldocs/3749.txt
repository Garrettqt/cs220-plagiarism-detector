If i had the right to remove books , music , magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it .
I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read , lisen and see whatever they want .
If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place .
Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education .
Everybody has the right to read whatever they want .
Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things .
If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out .
One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways .
The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it .
In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children .
Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids .
Removing books means taking away history from them .
There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive .
I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history .
Books , music , magazines , ect should not be remove from libraries .
Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not .
Removing this items would just be a total chaos .
They should leave the libraries just the way they are .
Everybody has the right to read , lisen and see whatever they want .
