Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them ?
Well I can , Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days .
Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad .
Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books , a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv .
Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear , or think that violence is alright .
Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like , but it's not alright .
Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years .
Banned books might have foul language and violence , but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it .
Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it , or someone killing another person .
Some banned books don't even have swear words in them ; ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day .
Some books , movies , magazines , etc .
should be removed for profanity and drugs .
I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list .
Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing .
In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly .
The children today dont need to be learning about sex , drugs , swearing , violence , etc .
I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about .
