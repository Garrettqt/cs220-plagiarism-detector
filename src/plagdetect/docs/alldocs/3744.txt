I dont think that music , magazines , books , or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do .
I think that if people dont want there children to see it then dont let them .
I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all .
I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago .
I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take it the wrong way .
I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right .
There is some stuff out there in books , magazines , and ect .
that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is .
Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down ?
No !
Some people homeschool their kids for that reason , but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do ?
I dont think so , there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to .
There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something .
People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway .
It is just hoe our economy is these days .
