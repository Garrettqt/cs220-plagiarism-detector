You go to a library to read books , music , and magazines , but soon you find out that there are very offensive books .
I strongly say yes , I agree that we should remove the books , magazines , and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people .
We are suppost to feel safe reading books , listening to music , and reading magazines .
When I was younger I went to the library all the time .
I would get books to read and look at , and for a while I was excited to go to the library , but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes .
Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me , but I know I was so upset by how the book was .
It had words that I never heard before , and I got confused .
This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book , but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something .
Bad books , offensive books , should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return .
I feel very strongly about this subject , because I am a book warm , I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library .
Offensive books , music , and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all .
When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them , but if there are offensive stuff out there , how will they be able to do that .
There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books , music , and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer , I still say yes , they should remove the offensive books , music , and magazines .
If it was your sister , your daughter , or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book , what would you say ?
I ask you this , how would you feel ?
