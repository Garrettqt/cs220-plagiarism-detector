Libraries @CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books , magazines , music and movies .
Libraries do have a purpose I must say , having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere .
Just think @CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place .
Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance , should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately .
If you 'd like to rent them you @MONTH1 ask for assistance , and go from @CAPS1 .
Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information .
In my own perspective @CAPS1 should be an adult section , where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out .
By keeping such materials shown or on display , @MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions .
As for music , it can go both ways .
Music is more of a lifestyle , some people can't live without it .
Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive ' is what they commonly say .
If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf , people @MONTH1 be turned away and your library @MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music , books , magazines and movies ?
An empty room .
Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up , or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at .
Taking away such materials @MONTH1 cause alot of grief .
Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and @CAPS1 will be no complications
