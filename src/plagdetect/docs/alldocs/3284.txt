Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word ?
Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears ?
No matter how hard you try , you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society .
Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book ?
Many books in today's libraries have offensive language .
Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader , but in other cases the reader @MONTH1 be offended .
In my personal view , if you do not like the language of the book , put it back on the shelf .
The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written , not the way you would like to see it .
Some material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers .
The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship .
For example , I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1 ' for its use of alcohol and drugs .
Many people find this movie funny and entertaining .
Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs ?
These words and actions we try to censor are not going away .
We see and hear them in everyday life , no matter where you @MONTH1 be .
So if you don't like the language in the book , choose a different one
