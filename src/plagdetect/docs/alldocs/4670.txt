Yes I do believe that certain books , movies , music , etc.
, should be removed .
They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area .
Because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior .
In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area .
Some where childern are unable to reach .
like in high areas like the top of the shelf , or the closet , maybe the attic .
For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe .
where no one is able to get things out .
It is important for some items to be seen , listened to , or watched for older people.For example , books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age .
Music can talk about stuff that that person done , and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it .
For the magazines they show articals of rapper , actors , and other famous people doing somthing wrong .
showing a bad example for the child.Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at .
Because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital .
From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good .
From that experience I 've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with .
Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern .
Because the outcome maynot be what you wanted .
serious actions might come from the objects , and later on come from the same child that either listed to , saw it , or looked at it .
So make sure the items are safe from childern hands
