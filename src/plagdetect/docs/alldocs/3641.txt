I believe that if you are at a library or movie store , or where ever and there are books , movies , magazines , or cd's that you think are offensive that they should most likley be taken off of the shelf .
Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not approprite for little kids , and you get a little embarassed yourself ?
I know I have at least one point and time in my life .
Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store , or at least the shelves .
I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they new what kind of music most teen's are listening to today .
There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isnt appropriate for anyone to hear , or even talk about .
Some people feel differant about this , and some people take it a little to serious , but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion
