I think censorship of certain materials , books , music , magazines , etc.
, that are offensive should be removed from people who have yet to mature , unless a parent or gardian approves of it .
I think censorship can be a positive things for little children and younger folk because kids that are young of age should not view or listen to things such as bad things .
These things can be a negitive influence on the child's character and personallity .
No one should hear other kids cursing in public becuase this can influence other kid to do the same .
I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings becuase this can influence them more to do it too than if some kid was saying or doing bad things .
Some censorship shouldn't be aloud to those who are matuered , such as in high school where you have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids becuase older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on people .
Censorship of certain materials , books , musicm magazines , ect.
, that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature , unless with parrent concent .
People who have not matured should not view or listen to any thing that is a negitive influence on themselves .
