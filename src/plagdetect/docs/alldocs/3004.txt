People are entitile to their own oppinion about things .
What someone might find offensive someone else might not .
Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person who educate someone on there shelves wether people get offended or not .
If we went by what everyone said we probably wouldnt have anything on the library shelves .
People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out thats just human nature .
I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true storys that have used word and language that some people might find offensivc but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone .
How are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story .
Slavery and the @PERSON1 were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again .
It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people .
I believe that we should put these materials on out library shelves anyway , and if people do not like it then do not check them out or look at them .
That's my opinion what's yours
