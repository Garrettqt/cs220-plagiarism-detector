I belive that thier should @CAPS3 be sesorship because we live in @LOCATION1 , @CAPS1 belive in freedom and I do to , sensorship is @CAPS3 the way.my thoughts about people that find a book offensive slould @CAPS3 read the book if thay heard it was a bad book or thay dident like the way the cover looks thats thier problem dont ruin it for everyone els that likes the book.say if two people found a book offensive an five people liked the book dose that mean that it should be removed.What if you where one of thos five people and your favorite book was gone and you asked why and the librariean said 'well two people flaged the book for being offensive so it was removed ' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 a book person but one time in school we read a book as a class called farenhite @NUM1 I thought it was a good book for its time , I head that some people wanted to ban the book and some people did.Two words for thos people @CAPS3 cool.I think if you walk into a librarie you sould expect to see alot of different ideas because thats freedom and the woulds @CAPS3 pefect.So what @CAPS2 saying is thay should come up with a new system for librareis if a majority of people flag book offensive and thay dont want their kids seeing it then thay sould seperate thos books , movies , magazines , ets.
, from erery thing els @CAPS3 remove them.A message to thos people -If you are one of thos people that finds a picifice book ofensive you should know where thay are and stay out of that side of the librareie.thats my thoughts and views on sesorship in libraries .
