In my opinion , they should not censor books .
They should be read the way that the author intended for @CAPS4 to be read .
I understand censoring songs and movies , though , so that they @MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters .
The books that are contraversial right now have great messages , and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them .
They were written with this language because @CAPS4's the way people talked back then .
These books are classics and should not be changed , or removed from the shelves .
In the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ' by @PERSON1 , they use a lot of bad language , but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers .
@CAPS4 should not be changed @CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio .
When an artist writes a song , they know that @CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if @CAPS4 has bad or graphic language .
I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear .
The song ' @CAPS5 You ' by @ORGANIZATION1 , they replaced the @CAPS6 word with ' @CAPS5 ' .
When he wrote this song , he knew that @CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio , so he changed a word , and @CAPS4 is still a good song .
Movies are about the same as songs , they can't show a movie in theaters if @CAPS4 is too graphic .
They @MONTH1 take out certain scenes , or change a few words , but that doesn't change the movie .
Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @CAPS4 is sold in stores .
I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter , I am just voicing mine .
If these authors , or artists , wanted their work to be different , they would 've made @CAPS4 so .
