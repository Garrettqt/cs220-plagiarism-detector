From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries .
All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects .
Even if that includes some of them being offensive .
Some subjects might be considerderd offensive , like the holocaust for example .
If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before .
But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive .
In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves .
People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better , more educated , well-rounded individual .
