As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive .
The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore .
Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned ; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already .
Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth .
Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south .
This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book .
If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature .
Just as the movies do for the gerneal population , @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up .
These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for .
This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries .
There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken .
There is the young adult section , adult , and youth .
Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs , sex , and alchohol .
Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth , but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically
