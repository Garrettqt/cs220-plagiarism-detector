Many people i know would be very upset if there was'nt anymore books on the shelves of the library .
I think there should be books that are offensive , who wants to read a book that is boring and not exciting.The libraries should have lables on the books so when people go to check them out the books there would have a lable that says this book @MONTH1 not be right for sertin people and my contain bad language .
Thats just a example .
There should be adult and children sections in the library maybe sections for every type of books like murder and mystery.That also goes for the movies , music and , magazines .
I love going though the books in the library you never know what to expect out a book
