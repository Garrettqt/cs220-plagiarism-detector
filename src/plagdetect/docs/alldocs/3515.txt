My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe .
With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate , evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier .
Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate , others @MONTH1 disagree .
That's why creating a rating system would be best .
With a rating system of books , movies , magazines , and other materials in a library , parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch .
If there is vulgar language inside of the book , it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is .
That way , if there are complaints of the item , the library would not be blamed .
I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others ' complaints should occur .
I believe that the books could be kept , but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal .
What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage ' ?
There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied , but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved .
My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe , but taking away perfectly written books is not right .
Disagreement isn't the easiest thing , but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up .
The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions
