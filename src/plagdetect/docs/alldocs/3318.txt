New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read ?
I know I have , and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies .
I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed , but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3 .
This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult , or with an adults permission .
Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff .
What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake , and the things that happen in movies aren't really true .
By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 , it gives parents the chance to get the racist , drug/gang filled , and murder books away from the children .
This will be good for every race too !
If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs , they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are .
Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions .
If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide , they are more likely to think about killing themself .
I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot .
People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent , or parent signature .
So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 !
Thank you for your time .
