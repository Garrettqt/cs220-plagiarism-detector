Do I believe that certain materials , suchs as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed for being offensive ?
No I do not .
My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good .
Most of it is very helpful information .
Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them , but most of it is history .
You can't change that .
If someone doesn't like a book , movie , or magaine , they shouldn't read it .
I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects .
If we need to know about slaves or slavery , we can go to our library .
Some peoples views on that is totally different , but hey .
We can't help what people did in the past .
We can only learn from their mistakes .
I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover , don't read it .
Look for something else more interesting to you .
I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me .
Or even bad .
They have books over everything .
Some of it can be bad , but mostly it all is good information .
They talk about history , and guns and drugs , and wars and all sorts of other history information .
There are books over stuff that isn't even true .
I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things .
If you don't like a book or movie , don't get it .
Look at the cover and if it seems appealing , get it .
But if not , don't waste time on complaining about it .
Because then things can get out of control .
That is my opinion on books , movies , magazines , etc in our libraries .
Mainly they seem very helpful , but others can have different opinions
