I think everything should be there .
The examples of things that should be there are : all magazines , books , and @CAPS1 service .
For the magazines there should be all cars , trucks , atvs , mtvs , utvs , espn , golf , game informers , and wwe magazines .
Now for the books .
All the types of of books that should be allowed are @CAPS2- @CAPS3 , @CAPS3 , @CAPS4 , @CAPS5 , @CAPS6 , and @CAPS7 books .
And last the @CAPS1 service .
The @CAPS1 service sould be used for school work , to play all games on any website , and to use youtube on any computer .
This all should be used there because certin things some kids don't have at home .
