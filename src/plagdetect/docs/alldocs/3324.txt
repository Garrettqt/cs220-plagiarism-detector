Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it .
I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them .
There are three reasons why they should have censorship .
First they can teach kids bad things , second bad influence , and third they just dont need to be there .
First was they can teach kids bad thing .
That is because they would start looking at it more .
Then they would get in trouble .
There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all .
Second , its a bad influence .
They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right .
Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future .
Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it .
Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor .
But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it .
I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life
