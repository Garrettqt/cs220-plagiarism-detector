Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section .
When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section .
Well censorship should be in librarys now a days .
Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age .
Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life .
In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children .
They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books , movies , music , games , and magizenes from that section .
For example , in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children .
Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores .
Personaly , I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games , movies , and some books .
While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them .
So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves .
Librarys do need to take these books , movies , games , music , and magazines off of the shelves .
If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement .
So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them .
It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books , games , magazines , and music .
As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do .
Yes , once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive .
Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age .
