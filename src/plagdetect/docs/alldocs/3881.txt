Now take a moment and go back to highschool .
Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom ?
What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1 ?
Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 ?
No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was , you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it .
It enveloped you into its world , and you felt every sensation it offered .
What is this though ?
The author is a @CAPS2 .
The author uses occassional bad words .
The author is a woman .
This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers .
Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong .
The @CAPS3 was a dark time .
Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief , as well as homosexual people , and other minorities .
Amidst all of this chaos , the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors .
So they did .
Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference .
Does it even need to be asked ?
This was wrong .
Many say that ignorance is bliss , but is it really when people impose their ideas on others ?
Let us now look now at what a book , movie , magazine , or song offends with to be censored .
A curse word , a bit of skin , a controversial idea .
Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation .
Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then .
Pathetic .
So is it worth it to you ?
Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial ?
Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions ?
One thing is certain , I will not .
I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works .
One day my plea will be heard .
Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it
