I do not think books , music , movies , magazines etc ... should be removed because they are offensive .
There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing .
Theres no reason for all that .
Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials .
First , if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty .
As well as the library , the movie store and everything else .
If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways , but just put it down and dont wory about it .
Second , i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us .
They show us the good and bad the right and wrong , thats what books are for .
Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such .
But to some more than others .
You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them .
For instance , say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do ?
Is it going to make the word a beteter place ?
I dont think so .
I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be .
To educate and informate .
In conclusion , i do not think offensive materials should be remove .
We would have nothing and the libraries , movie stores and books would be empty .
We would also be pretty missinformed about life .
So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves
