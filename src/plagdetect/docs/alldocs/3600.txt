Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages .
That is where my opinion will start , and tell why it is that way .
I will talk about why I disagree with this statement .
Also , give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement .
I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like .
The library is where they get the books from .
So , just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there .
I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book .
If the parents explain , kids will understand why it is not good for them .
Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting .
I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them , then they are old enough for it .
Also , the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them , therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate .
Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it .
This is taking a right away from us , and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once .
If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them ?
So , if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now .
People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them .
This is my opinion of the statement .
Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement .
Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy .
Also , I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them .
