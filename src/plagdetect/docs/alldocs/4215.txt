I think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at .
I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section .
I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone .
Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books .
If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them .
I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that .
When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions .
I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it .
My conclusion is , if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at .
You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions
