Do you think that if certain books , music , movies , and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive ?
Such as magazines , books , movies , and even music .
I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons .
Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy .
The first reason I think that certain books , music , movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves .
Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks , seems , or even sounds offensive .
Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly .
For example , why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them ?
The second reason that I think that certain books , music , movies , and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book , type of music , a movie , or a magazine .
Most likely you 're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste .
So if there is a book , some sort of music , a movie , or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like , seems like , or even sounds like .
In my opinion I think that if certain books , music , movies , and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf .
If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy , you will obviously end up knowing if something looks , seems , or even sounds offensive
