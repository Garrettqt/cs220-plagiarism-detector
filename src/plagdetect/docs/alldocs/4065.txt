There are many libraries with many books , magzines , music , and movies .
Some of the things in a library are inappropiate for children .
So the library makes a section for the adult's and a section for the children .
There should just be a children library and then make another library for the adult's .
Then I also think that they should take the bad things of the shelf's at libraries .
So there are children books and there adult books .
In most libraries I seen that they either have and upstairs for the adult's and they have a downstairs for the kid's .
They also have toy's down there for kids so if there parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toy's .
Then I also think that they should take off the bad things on the shelf's .
Becuase wjat happens if a kid goes up with there mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropiate ?
So they should be taken off the shelve's in a library , and if someone wants to buy them then will have to go online or to the store and buy them .
The people that own the liobrary or are in the library should take all the bad magazines , music , books , and ect .
off the shelf's .
It is a very bad thing to have at a public place , and that should not be aloud .
The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things of the shelf's 's
