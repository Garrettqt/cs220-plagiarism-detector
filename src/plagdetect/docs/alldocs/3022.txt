Libraries , to myself , are a gateway to another world ; where I can be who I want to be , and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases .
Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content .
We are all different people , we all don't enjoy the same kind of books .
Also , some books @MONTH1 be needed for research .
Censorship in a library should not be allowed .
First , there are so many different people in the world .
Some people learn more about people from books .
Imagine yourself a white , @NUM1 year old boy , growing up in an all white town .
Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .
You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 . '
@CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism .
Books are history .
Books are learning .
Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content .
That content might be a whole other world for a young child .
Next , libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school .
Books are needed for research .
For an example , you 're a college student writing a research paper on abuse -- including sexual , physical , and mental .
A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school .
After hours of searching , you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content .
College students need books no matter what they 're about .
Libraries are open to people of all age .
It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level , but that's why libraries are split into sections .
If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves , don't remove it , just move it to a more secure and mature area
