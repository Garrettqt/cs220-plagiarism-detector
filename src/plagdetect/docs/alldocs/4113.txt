No , I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries .
Because some people like stuff other people @MONTH1 find offensive .
But you as parents should control what your kids are reading .
If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book , new @CAPS1 , a new movie , or a new magazine .
If you don't its not their fault it's your fault .
Some people like stuff that others don't .
Such as , stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion .
But we can choose to read what ever you want to .
If you don't like it find something else but , some people find it interesting .
Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff .
If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in .
Make it to were you have to show an @CAPS2 that says you are @NUM1 or older to get in .
Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them .
Than in order to check them out if you 're under the age of @NUM1 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it .
If it's a @CAPS1 or musican that has cussing in it you need to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent check @NUM4 out for you .
Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music .
Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people @MONTH1 find inapproite .
Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same .
People are different like different things
