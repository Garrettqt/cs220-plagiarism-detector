'' I feel that materials , such as book , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
Some @CAPS1 like offensive things that they have in the library .
Some @CAPS1 would sometimes want to know about certain things that is offensive.Most @CAPS1 could be offensive to alot of different things.Different @CAPS1 have different things that are offensive.What might be offensive to you probably not offensive to me . ''
@CAPS1 that dont like offensive things just shouldnt check it out and @CAPS1 that like offensive things jus could check it out.I feel that they just shouldnt be removed just because @CAPS1 dont like offensive things they just shouldnt check it out.You just cant removed things that are offensive just because some @CAPS1 dont like offensive things .
Everyone do have their own right but some @CAPS1 like offended things .
I read a book that was offended to me , but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation .
So some things @MONTH1 offend you , but some things you just have to read about it more because some things tell you how to overcome that situation or it will tell you what to do about the situation you had been offended by.Thats why I feel that you shouldnt remove offensive books .
