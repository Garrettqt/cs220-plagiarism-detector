I think they souldnt be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opions .
one person @MONTH1 think a book is offensive but the next @MONTH1 not .
Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion .
If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive there would be no books left .
Because people think differently .
Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books , so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont .
There are many books out there that not everybodys gon na like the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong
