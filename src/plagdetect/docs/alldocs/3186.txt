No , I would not think it would be the right thing to do .
To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them .
Its not only one person to decide that .
People or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause it's offensive to them.Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away .
Thier could be many people out thier that really like that book or those books , and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore .
All because one person or a few other people don't like the book.Yes their are books out thier that a lot of people don't like but that still don't give one person to throw the book out , all because they don't like that book or that seires of a book .
No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a libary and throw it out because they don't like it .
Their could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it , now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book .
Thats why I don't think books that some one thinks is offensive should be taken out of a libary .
Because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away .
If you think the book is that offensive to you just stay away from that area of the libary and don't think about that book
