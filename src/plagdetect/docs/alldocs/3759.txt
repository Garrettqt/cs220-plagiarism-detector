In my opinion , I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library .
Magazines , comics , books , music , and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic .
The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves .
And lastly , the readers , who can do all of the above and read !
I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it .
but in order for that to happen , that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read .
I hope understand through my point of view All I 'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet .
Why not start learning in a nice , calm , relaxing township library
