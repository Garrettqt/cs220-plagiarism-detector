Today I am going to talk about certain materials , such as books , music , movies , and magazines .
Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive ?
In todays world it is hard to please every living soul .
Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time .
Life as we know it , everybody lives it a different way , and in a different place , but everybody has read a book , listened to music , and even read a magazine a time or to .
People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others .
Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from , unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out .
My conclusion is that you cant please everybody .
I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn .
