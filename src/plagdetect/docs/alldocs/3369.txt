All kid's have their own style of books , @CAPS1 people like scary , funny , or romance books , but can we really take that to an offense ?
We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person , @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up ' books or magazines , libraries have all types of syles for different people , you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you .
I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive .
All libraries are different types of books , for example an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books , and a middle school will not have little kid books .
We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read ?
, for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books , and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1 , and I had to change my reading style to fit in , so that's exactly what I did .
Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf , I believe that if there is 'offensive ' books in your library , just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book , we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading .
Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste , so just look for that right book that suites you , and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf , @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover
