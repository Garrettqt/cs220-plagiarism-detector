Books , music and movies are all important , specially to kids .
If we decide to take one book off of the shelf , then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty .
The same idea for movies , magazines , music , ect .
Even though , some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library , it is the parents ' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch .
Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards .
These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults ' materials depending on the kind of card the person has .
Since it is the parents ' decision to decide the materials their children have access to , they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf .
Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society .
If we try to remove every single book , movie , song , or magazine that contain an offensive thing , we would have to remove almost everything .
People have different cultures and beliefs .
They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing .
In the current society , a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media .
We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them .
There are different kinds of channels that view these materials .
Internet , @ORGANIZATION1 , and libraries can all be under parents ' supervision .
Thus , parents can not blame anyone other than themselves , if their children read or saw unacceptable materials .
Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change .
Parents need to have full supervision to their children .
Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age
