I do agree with this topic at hand , some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropite or sometimes valgar .
Way too @MONTH1 people get away with way too many things in this day and age .
Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete , utter disaster .
Something has to be done to put an end to this madness .
Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropite book up on the self , that @CAPS1 is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book .
Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book , type of media , or entainment that is not suitable for their age group .
Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing , why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed ?
That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to .
I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music comming from my nine year old sister's room .
I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutley awful , @CAPS1 was singing about drugs , sex , and alcohol .
I went in her room and turned @CAPS1 off and questioned her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from .
She replied 'the library . '
That's just another example of what I 'm speaking about .
If someone at the age of nine can check out a @CAPS2.D .
like that , then imagine what is avalible to me at the age of sixteen .
Adolessence do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary .
I 'm just afraid for the next generation ; what are they going to be listening to ?
What are they going to be reading ?
And @CAPS1's not just the library , @CAPS1's everywhere !
We can't even live a day of our lives in this society with out hearing something bad on the radio , on tv , or even in public .
Everywhere we turn is something bad or valgar .
So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit .
We need to stand up for what's appropite and what's right
