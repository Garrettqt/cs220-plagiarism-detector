If the library is in a highschool then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive .
In case we haven't though you can't shield your kids from offensive material .
This @CAPS1 hurts them in the long run .
Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up a important assignment or task he @MONTH1 use terms such as the ' @CAPS2 ' word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is .
If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you there is a chance you would have a break down or be ineffective for work .
Now im not saying we should all 'cuss ' every day and talk in vulgar tongue .
Im just saying that the real world doesnt have a 'clean ' version .
there is no mom or dad there to stand by and say , 'oh no thats not acceptable speech son ' .
If you took a survey of daily langauge of teens and young adults almost @PERCENT1 would say they use some form of vulgar langauge or inapporiate terms .
We need to have our kids and teens to know its not ok to say those things and they need to know what is acceptable in society and not .
but taking from them in the library and then thrusting them in a world with daily inapproite acts in not right
