Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion .
If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay , but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone .
Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is , but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others .
If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect .
then just ignore it and go on .
There is no reason to take those kinds of books out , for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs .
Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future .
The @CAPS1 is a good example , in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional , that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques .
There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers .
Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors , taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books .
For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving .
If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it .
A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted .
The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction .
