Definately not , they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all .
Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life , so their is no real reason to censor materials .
These materials are made to entertain someone , some are entertained by offensive material .
I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out .
If any material offends you , you dont have to acknowledge it , you can always check out different material .
If censor material then you are going against the first amendment , @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 .
Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored , what happens when every book has been marked as offensive ?
We have no books , thats what .
Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot , some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will .
Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books .
Anyone can create material and share their idea's , those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter , because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it .
If you ban any type of material , your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions , then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite .
Censorship of music and movies is not right either .
When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's .
Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion .
Censorship of the movies , music , & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture .
All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture .
