Do your rights end where mine begin ?
In such a diverse society , clashing opinions are unavoidable .
Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices , beliefs , or lifestyle ?
Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion .
What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others .
For example , one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem .
Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing , religion , or violence disscused in published works .
These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear .
It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world , and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that .
Censoring books , magazines , music , and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view .
Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist .
The saying 'one year older , one year wiser ' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions .
As a child grows , he will learn more about the materials that were censored .
In some cases , such as in the classroom , your rights do end where mine begin .
When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity , everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf .
The definition of 'offensive material ' is simply a matter of opinion .
