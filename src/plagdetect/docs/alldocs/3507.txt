How can writing be offensive ?
Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive .
Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting .
Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts .
It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive .
That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left .
It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote , ' ... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head .
That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out .
I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head .
If we find something offensive , simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt .
We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read .
Everyone sees things differently .
What about children , can we trust their better judgement ?
I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults .
The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries .
The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age .
Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them .
If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it .
We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2 .
Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country .
Just think if they would have censored those ideas .
Would we still be @LOCATION1 today ?
What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement .
