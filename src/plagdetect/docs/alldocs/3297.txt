There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers , though they can still check the books out in the library .
They can take them home , read it , and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age .
Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age .
The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie .
Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers .
You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language .
Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be .
Things today are way different .
My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either .
I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things .
It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not .
My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready .
The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages .
Although some people will not agree .
There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them
