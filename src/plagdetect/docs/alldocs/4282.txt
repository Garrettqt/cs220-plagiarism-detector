Now days people can get offended over anything .
In todays trying time readers , listeners , even wirters , are trying to get what they want not what the consumer wants .
Even though some stories , books , or articles , are completly bogus it shouldn't matter .
Dont let others opinions ruin it for everyone else .
Many people get offended now days over absolutly nothing ; and they feel the need to do somthing about it .
whitch nesessarly isn't a bad thing but isn't a good thing either.It is freedom of speach , or so thats what the constitution says , meaning folks have the right to read , write , or say , anything they please .
Fake and bogus writings is a small problem to readers , and writers .
People are reading articles , and book and believing every bit of what they read or write or even hear on their radio in recent times .
It is hard to believe anything now days , because you never really know the facts unless you experence them your self .
Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for , but still that goes back to the freedom of speach .
Reading , and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know .
Just don't let other readers opinions get in the way of a great thing
