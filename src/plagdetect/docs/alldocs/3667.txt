Why should they take them off the shelves ?
If you ask me i think they should leave @CAPS1 up their .
I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there .
Not only is @CAPS1 happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also .
Everything in the library might not offend some people .
Some people take @CAPS1 offensive when they see something thats against their religion , culture , or maybe their country .
But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about @CAPS1 .
I say , 'If you check out the library and find something that you take offensive , don't get @CAPS1 just beacuse you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1 .
So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1 ? '
@CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them .
Like someone said a pastor was on tv , talkin about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad .
He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off tv .
But she didn't havve to watch him on tv , she could of watched something else .
Nobody made her watch @CAPS1 , she chose to watch @CAPS1 .
So what I 'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said , ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor , then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else . '
@CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf , think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you .
