What do we find offensive ?
In a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone .
For example with movies there are horror , sci-fi , comidey , romance , advinture , etc .
and all of them are offensive to someone .
If we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person all the movies would be taken off .
Should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves , or leave them so people who do enjoy them do .
I belive that we should leave these materials alone .
It should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves .
If a person finds a item offensive , then they should ecnore it , not make a big deal of it .
Many poeple learn to keep their oppeins to themselves but some do not .
People who juge by what they don't like , tend to make themselves known
