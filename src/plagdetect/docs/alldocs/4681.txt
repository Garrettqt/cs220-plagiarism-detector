I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read .
Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel .
Some people want to read about crimes , mysterys , and action .
There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others .
I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said .
For example : @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive .
The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life .
I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others , but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended .
Books about war to some people are too graffic .
But those books about war are probably books about history .
I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like .
But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library .
They just want something to read .
I say leave the librarys alone !
