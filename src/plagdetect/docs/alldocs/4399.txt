There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf .
They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity .
As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them .
Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an @CAPS1 book or what ever he can get his hands on .
When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language .
We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat .
I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it , even the teacher thought it was funny .
But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office .
Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book .
I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it .
I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early .
Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them .
My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang .
But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older .
Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids .
