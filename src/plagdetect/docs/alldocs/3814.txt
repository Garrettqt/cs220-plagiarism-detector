I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful .
Then you should have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out .
The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong .
I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it .
It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read .
BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it .
If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do .
The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff .
What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work .
People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games .
But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people like them being there for them .
