Many things such as books , music , magazines , ect.
, causes problem acts for children to act different , but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed .
Many children get their acts from books , movies , and magazines but most get their acts from something different .
Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies .
So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television .
But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages .
just like legal things only legal for adults .
I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends .
When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever .
And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often .
So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed .
