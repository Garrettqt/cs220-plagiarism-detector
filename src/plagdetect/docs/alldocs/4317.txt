I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries , because we all have the right to choose what we want to read , listen to and watch .
Even if people banned some books from the libray , other people would find a way to get them .
we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely , which also includes the right to read freely .
As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far .
We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing , and music that promotes sex , drugs , violence , and alcohol .
The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies , music , and television .
With magazines its a little more complicated than the others , maga zines have their own set of standards .
We all know about @CAPS1 , @PERSON1 , and @CAPS2 , but think about all of the magazines that we dont see .
The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out .
