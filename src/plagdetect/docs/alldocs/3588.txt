If I was to right about to a news paper that are childing should not be looking at book and shoud be tacken off the shelf .
The reson I say that is so are cirlden are not geting ideads from a book that is not aproprit for them .
I thank that is the mane reson there are more girls geting pragnit at a young age .
I thank if we were to tack off the notey book there would be less girls pragnet .
I realy thank it could work if we would tack all of the notey books off the shelf and mack it a law that you hade to be a sherton age to look at them .
I would like to see a chang in the way we look at notey book .
I thank you should be @NUM1 to look at books that are notey .
It would be a good thang to try for a wiyel .
I thank it woukd work because it would not been showin to are childer and they would not whant to have babys as a teenager .
This is the way I thank it should have been done in the farist place .
We would not have so miny probloms in the frist place .
The than is I thank thay not thak it well be to hard to race a chiled at a young age .
If we would not have to see thans that we shouldent have seen .
