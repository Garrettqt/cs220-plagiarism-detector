Dear Newspaper staff , @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade .
The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive .
The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc .
In @CAPS7 books , magazines , movies , have things in it that shouldnt be in there .
When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it .
When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on .
If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music , the virus on the computer and the books being riped up .
But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things .
If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves .
That would be so wonderful for everyone .
If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes .
When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape
