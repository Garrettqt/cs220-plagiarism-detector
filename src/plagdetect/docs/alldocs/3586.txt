Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see .
If you were offended by that one thing , do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned ?
Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had , but someone else didn't ?
Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve ?
What if @NUM1 people came into a library with @NUM2 books , magazines , music and movies , and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book , magazine , music , and movie taken out ?
Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw ?
Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve , that they get to pick ?
I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that .
If something is that offensive to that many people , they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like .
If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing ?
The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things .
It could only get worse .
I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it .
One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could , otherwise have separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges .
If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy .
