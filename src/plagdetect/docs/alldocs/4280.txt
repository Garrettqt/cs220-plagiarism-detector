Books ?
Movies ?
Music ?
Magazines ?
We all like to read them , watch them , and listen to them .
@CAPS2's hard to stop all that .
Plus , @CAPS2's impossible to stop .
Everywhere you go you can find these items .
Such as the movie store , the mall , a gas station , a yard sale , and even your public library .
People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book , movie , a @CAPS1 , or a magazine and @CAPS2's perfectly fine .
But , there is one problem .
Censorship .
Yes that's what i said , 'censorship . '
@CAPS2 means alot to some parents when @CAPS2 comes to their children .
Espescially when @CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live .
If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect .
that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things ' in @CAPS2 that children shouldn't see is a problem .
They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @CAPS1 or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity , violence , racial pictures , or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone , just not parents .
A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea .
There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things ' because we all know that is not right .
Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age .
I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books , movies , music , magazines , ect .
should censorize there things .
But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults ' or 'young adults ' or 'kids ' .
If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship .
Censorship should be practiced everywhere .
