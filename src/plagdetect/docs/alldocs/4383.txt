I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant .
Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk .
Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow .
A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems .
Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law .
On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children .
For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+ .
I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if you want to change them or not
