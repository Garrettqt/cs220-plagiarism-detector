There are so many things these days that people find offending , in so many different places in magazins , books , movies , cell phones , on the internet , even some words in songs .
Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self .
A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this ?
I dont want them reading this !
What if it messes up their childhood ?
Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at ?
On the occasion that they do get ahold of it , then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with .
Also if evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read , listen to , or watch .
Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end .
For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable , but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending .
It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites .
Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well , and would not be a good idea .
If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world .
This world is harsh and not easy at all times .
Kids learn alot of this through the media .
As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong , and they should not take part in it , then why would it need to be removed ?
If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger , we would have nothing left to read watch or see , and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media .
So now i ask you , what do you think
