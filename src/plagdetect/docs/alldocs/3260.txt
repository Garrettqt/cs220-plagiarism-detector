' @CAPS1 , @CAPS1 , @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie , when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung . '
@CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men .
While ' @CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder ' tells us that love can be found anywhere .
Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both .
The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere , and anywhere .
To say that music , magazines , books , and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay .
Well its not ; banning books , music , etc .
is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity .
It is just like the book @DATE1 , where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching , and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read , and even think .
Taking away movies and books , is to not allow people to learn from their past .
Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example , though that movie is rather gory and morbid , it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go .
Always remeber the past so you can learn from it .
Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions .
A book , magazine , movie , etc are all gateways to new worlds , where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is .
I can say that books and songs have saved lives .
The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong .
I was @NUM2 at the time , and i rushed through my ipod to find a song ' @CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 ' by the @CAPS17 .
I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away .
While yes , there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things , even to kill .
We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing .
Because they are all ways to express ourselves .
A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away .
Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored .
If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away , it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more , it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing
