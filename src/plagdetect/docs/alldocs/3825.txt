It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books , movies , and music .
I 've confronted them and they 've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place .
I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences , but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire .
These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor .
What I 've noticed is , the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate , heartfelt labors of expression ; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished .
This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple , our own expression .
The capibilities of the human mind are limitless , but yet those who display it's functions are limited .
Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds .
I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash .
Just out of a few broken heartstrings ?
Or a spare tear lost upon the earth , dusted by some ignorance forsaken , missunderstood language doomed to be lost ; out of a loss of understanding ?
I think not .
In conclusion , I 've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship .
I 'm only one voice , but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together .
So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression
