I believe that not all books should be banned , but some books should .
For example their are many good books that are banned because it @MONTH1 have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok , I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his @CAPS1 .
But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned , such as hate against other races , or it talks negatively about someones religion .
For example I read a very famous book called The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 by @PERSON4 .
This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 so I couldn't check it out .
I had to go to the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to get it .
I don't understand what is so wrong with The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 that it is banned by @ORGANIZATION2 .
This book @MONTH1 talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away , does alot of differnt crazy activites , and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on @CAPS1 .
If I was a administrator in a @ORGANIZATION1 I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express .
For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the @PERSON1 , this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve .
But if it is a book about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery this would be ok. Because the @PERSON2 book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the @PERSON2 and that isnt right .
But the book on the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed .
So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it @MONTH1 not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express.Hopefully you will agree with me in this .
But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned , such as hate against other races , or it talks negatively about someones religion .
I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the @ORGANIZATION1 that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves .
