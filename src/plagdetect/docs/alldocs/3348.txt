Have you ever found books , movies , music , and magazines that are about drugs , sexuality , and violence ?
I think that books , movies , music , and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs , sesuality , and violence .
There are many reasons why I think that those books , movies , music , and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries .
One reason is because little kids can get ahold of the book , the kind of music , the movie , and the kind of magazine that contains drugs , sexuality , and violence then they can learn how to do those kinds of things .
A second reason why I think that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because I feel like a library is not a place to have those kinds of books , magazines , that kind of music , or that kind of movies for parents and their kids to read about and to watch , or even to listen to music that contains drugs , sexuality , and violence .
The third reason why I believe that they should be removed form the shelves of libraries is because thoes kinds of materials belong in another building , a building that is far away form children and only certain people can get into the building and look at the books , magazines , watch the movies , and listen to music that contians that kind of stuff .
The last reason why I believe that they should be removed is because from experience , one time I found a book about drugs I looked at it but it was very unappropate for little kids to look at , it had pictures of what drugs look like , what certain durgs can do to the body .
In conclusin I hope who ever is reading this that you realize what these books , moveis , music , and magazines are doing to the people that are reading them , watching them , and listening to them
