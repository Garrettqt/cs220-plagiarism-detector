Removing books off of shelves in our public library ?
To me , that sounds crazy .
I can see how some people might be offended by some books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, but some people appreciate it .
It's diversity , some people love the down-to-earth literature , but some people can't handle it .
Why take away something that only a few people disagree with ?
I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive , but it is all fact .
I mean , if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in .
If people want to complain then they can get out of that section , because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment .
Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive , but I believe it makes that person stronger .
It helps them realize how lucky they are that they 're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they 're reading .
It's just a piece of entertainment !
If it offends you and you 're not entertained , go find something that does !
Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I 've never really seen one myself .
I think some people just get offended too easily .
That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands .
So what if they aren't taken off the shelves ?
Like I said , we can make a certain section for them type of things .
If they aren't happy with the outcome , they will get over it .
Now that you read what I had to say , what do yu think ?
Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves ?
Or should we just reason with the people who are offended ?
I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy !
