Books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching : seeing : or hearing them .
Vielence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight .
We already have a high teen vielence rate .
Our teen vielence rate really needs to be lowered .
When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves .
The movies in my oppion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight .
They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out .
Movies are a bad influnes on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing .
Movies could also get kids to be bullies .
When a kid is a bullie they don't really know what they are getting themselves into .
Another bad example would be drugs and alchoale .
Teens and other children get put into peer prushior .
When teens and other children have peer prushior its hard to say NO .
The kinds of music people listen to .
Music could also be a bad influence on kids .
The music that kids listen to would have something about killing , drugs , and alchoale .
When kids get involved in drugs and alchoale that will mess up their whole life .
For example the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone .
Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading .
Magazines have bad imangs in them and when teens see the imangs they want to act and or be just like the people that are in them pictures .
Books , movies , music and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the vielence .
There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer prushior .
That is why im persuativing you to take the books off the shelves
