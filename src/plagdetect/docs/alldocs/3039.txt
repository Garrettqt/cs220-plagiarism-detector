I think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library .
Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library : yes and no .
The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for .
Another reason why I say no is because of the fact , if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone .
The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or thier elders .
If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap .
If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other , just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races .
These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain voilence in them or call another person out of thier name or race
