I dont thank so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public .
if the person or persons find the peice of material offending then they should pass the item .
or they can skim over it .
on the other hand the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law .
if music is played in the library that others do find offended then in my opinion yes they should and can speak up for their rights .
books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended .
this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books .
this is because people hav different personalities which mean we wll like different things .
that does not mean that others can not speak their opinion because like i said earlier every one in the united states of america has the right to speak what is on their mind even though it @MONTH1 not be what others want to hear they can still do it .
well that is my opinion on what i think should happen .
