Would you censor the @CAPS1 ?
i @CAPS2 i sure would not .
The @CAPS1 is a very percious and religoius part of our nation and history , but this is just a mere example .
There are thousand of books , newpapers , articles , and media that play and important role in the history and the future of human beings .
Common sense or also referered as common knowledge is something that we dont pick up outa no where .
We absoub it thought this that do , see , and read .
An example is the 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 ' this is a book of a @CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the @CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy .
Throught out the story the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apple , its branches , and even its trunk .
but the @CAPS5 is happy .
at the very end of the story they former young boy is now a old man that just wants a place to rest so the @CAPS5 straightens up his stumb and is just happy with @CAPS4 the old man his happiness .
Now would you censor that ?
!
That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life .
That @CAPS4 someone else happiness is the true gift of life .
Now relegion is something that is censored alot these day ...
Why ?
!
The @CAPS1 for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together .
Indivigle tha stories are just little reminders of right and wrong , kindness and jelousy .
Its doesnt say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night .
its just helpfull advise , And really who has not asked someone else for advice ?
@CAPS8 relgion on tv , in schools , and everywhere else is telling us we dont need relegion for us to be productive and honest .
Me coming from a roman catholic and christian background have never really went to church or read the @CAPS1 am swelled up about relegion .
Thanks to a close friend .
@CAPS8 could also be good at its points though .
For an example @CAPS8 adult type content from minors is helpfull sence little kids dont @CAPS2 much of anything .
They just go with the flow .
Another example is @CAPS8 mail sent to different countries .
This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war .
so i will say that @CAPS8 can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad .
Such as @CAPS8 relegious content , or @CAPS8 classical book that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future .
This stuff is something that should be @CAPS10 by ages and ages to come !
