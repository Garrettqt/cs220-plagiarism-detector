I dont think there should be any censorship good books and music shouldint be removed just becaus one person finds it offensive .
Becaus the opinion's of one @MONTH1 be diffrent with another.I beleave music is cencord the most becaus not many people get offendid by books but censorship in music i think is destroying it.Becaus its an artists way of expresion and if people dont wana listen to what there saying then they should just not listen to it.Books i think shouldint be taken offensivly forthe same reason music shouldint its a writers oppinion and expresion its like telling someone they cant voice there oppinion on anything like racesim or use curse words if they want .
