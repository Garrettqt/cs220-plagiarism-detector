Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about .
Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it , while others think that it is sutable for the public .
Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read .
People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see .
Firstly , people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read .
They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see .
The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it .
Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it .
Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it .
Secondly , some music and movies should be banned .
Music has become a way for people to express them selves .
Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos ' are alright to talk about .
One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 .
Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message .
Movies are in the same boat as music .
They are showing the violence that people only have in their head .
@PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave , just because he could .
Although , somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads .
I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out .
In conclution , @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser .
@CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say .
This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read
