Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all .
Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi .
Everyone is offended by something ; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore .
@PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics .
@PERSON1 is the reason why there is an ' @CAPS1 ' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics .
Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all .
It hides the authors thoughts , idea , and meanings behind their writing .
I 've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 .
The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in .
Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books .
Pre- @CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally .
Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones .
It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false .
My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read .
I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine ; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it .
A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life .
