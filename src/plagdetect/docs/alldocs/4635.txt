Censorship in libraries is good in some ways .
People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books .
Things that offend people : for instance , a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly .
But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous .
either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive .
My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me .
But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word , 'nigger , ' in it and I found it a little offinsive .
That word just really isn't nice .
People like different books movies magazines ect.
, and some of the greatest movies of all time , well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way .
What some might find offinsive , others might think different .
Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit .
or for addvertising liquir .
All together , just about everything is offinsive to somone out there .
If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed , then there would hardly be any books movies ect.
, and not only that it would suck all together
