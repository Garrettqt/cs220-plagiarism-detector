One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies .
Thats why the books , magazines , or movies shouldn't be removed from the book shelf of the library .
They shouldnt be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read .
Only if they are doing what the parent says .
Also the parents might think to much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get .
Although , if your one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen , and you realize that every kid doesnt know what their parent wants , then you should talk to the school's principle and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have , or ever read , or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books .
Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very dissappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf , and they didn't have anything else to read , but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school .
If someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable .
I would say to them that , its not the book .
The kids chose to read the book in the first place , so it would be their own doing if their life changed .
Finally , thats the reason why books shouldnt be taken off the book shelf because some people like them , and if you are some of the kids or parents who dont like them or don't want their kids reading them , then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't aloud to check them out
