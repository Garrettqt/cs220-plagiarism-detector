No i do not figure that .
I say that there is some material for adults , teens and children .
The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wan na read the childrerns books the teens aren't going to want to read the childrens books but they @MONTH1 want to read the adult books and thats ok .
They will be adults soon they @MONTH1 be interested .
there is nothing wrong with that .
If the parents do not want there teens or children reading that kindf of material then they should go with them to the libary and make them get you approvial befor checking out the books , magazines or wwhatever it is they wan na read at the time .
Movies are the samje there are different materials for each age group some age groups @MONTH1 be interested in other age groups material and thats ok doesn't maen it's wrong just means thetre maturing more and are interested or couriouse let them explore they will figurt for them serlfs if the material is righrt for them or not
