Picture this : you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house , you hear music blaring from your child's room .
As you step closer , you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music , it's completely unedited , expicit versions of vulgar songs .
Now , who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking , doing drugs , and other various risky activities are okay ?
I know I sure wouldn't .
Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society .
It can be found nearly anywhere .
In books , magazines , @CAPS1 shows , movies , on the @CAPS2 , you name it .
All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages .
That is why there should be censorship of certain materials , to a certain degree .
By this , I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library , it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age .
Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world .
There should just be a limitation on who can view it .
That applies to everything that could contain offensive material .
Kids are kids .
There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them -- such as explicit movies , books , music , etc.
-- as they do not need to know about drugs , sex , or alcohol at such a young age .
Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be .
But , as mentioned earlier , censorship should only be to a certain degree .
Keeping childrens ' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general
