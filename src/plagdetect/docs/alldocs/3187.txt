The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others .
Whether it is a magazine , movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another .
If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public .
I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed .
Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it .
Why would anyone else want the opposite ?
Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child .
We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for .
Its not only kids either that are affected , adults also are affected by the media .
Adults can get fooled too , beleive me .
I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason .
I beleive that what the librarians did was right .
Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things .
Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student .
I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it .
Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child .
There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities
