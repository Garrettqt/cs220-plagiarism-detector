Should books , magazines , music , movies , and ect .
be censored for certin age levels ?
No they should'ent .
Books can be very educational .
Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them .
Even if they do , sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country .
Books can't be censored from children .
Why you ask ?
Because the reason people read books is to learn .
To learn about love , math , history , and much more .
These books are writen by adults , not for adults , but for everyone to read .
I read lots of books , and every book that I read I learn someting new .
Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys , cursing was huge in books .
But it wasent just to curse , it was to show the full dioulge of the character .
It also set the mood of the era , and the place , where the story is being held .
Such as in war books the characters curse a lot .
The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was , ' @CAPS1 !
! '
That isn't how the character would act .
The man would curse his lungs out .
Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say , the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book .
As the quote says , everyone has the same right to read , which is true .
Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in .
Right ?
I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about , and then have the freedom to do that .
So should books in a library be censored ?
No defenitly not .
its the best way for people to learn what life is really like .
Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words , sex , or violance .
People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age .
But it wont , it will only show them how not to act .
And can only create a better person .
