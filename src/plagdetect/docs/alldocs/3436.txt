I think that books , music , movies , and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries .
People find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them .
I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset .
In our generation today , people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents .
Music these days have a lot of bad language in them , but that's what makes people interested in them .
The same with movies .
Books , music , and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse , illegal drugs , and criminal involvement .
This kind of stuff gets our attention , and makes us interested .
If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch , listen , or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it .
Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it , so they don't have to worry about others seeing it .
People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves .
People can make there own decision of what they want to listen , watch , or read .
Everybody can choose what they prefeir .
Everybody has their own opion on things .
I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without .
Younger people find more interest in the things that seeem like a dream , or things that seem so unreal .
I think that they should keep offensive music , books , movies , and magazines out on shelves , because we have our own freedom to do what we want .
Lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things .
If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries
