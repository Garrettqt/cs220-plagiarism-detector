Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No , I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books , magazines , movies , music and etc .
But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them .
Unless they allow them in the area were the books , movies , magazines , etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them .
There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books , that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why , an how there children learning things like that .
Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read , see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that .
My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that .
So that's why I 'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see
