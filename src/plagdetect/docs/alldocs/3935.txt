Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves In every library it is intitle to have all types of books , movies , and magazines.Even if they are good or bad .
Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves .
Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like .
If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world , because not everything that is said on television is true .
Every library in the world should not take certian books , movies , and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 .
If the libraries took down certain books , movies , and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources .
Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books , movies , or magazines should be in the library , but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading , looking at magazines to see whats new , or watching all different types of moive , and listening to music .
I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books , moive , or magazine that would offend people today .
Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended , they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books , magazines , or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about
