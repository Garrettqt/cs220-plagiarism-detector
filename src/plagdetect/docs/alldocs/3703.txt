I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books , movies , music , magazines ect .
People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf .
People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff .
Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like , but I dont think they should not be in libraries .
They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to .
There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive .
For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1 .
People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life .
He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear .
His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life .
In history @CAPS2 because he killed people .
Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive , yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened .
If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self .
which is a saying I have heard many of times .
So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn , edgucate , and entertain themselves by .
Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people
