I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive .
Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another .
People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel , but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book .
I understand that parents want to protect children .
Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book .
Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve .
I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies .
When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played .
My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to .
She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it .
I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies .
She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went .
I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision .
I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child .
Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away .
That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable
