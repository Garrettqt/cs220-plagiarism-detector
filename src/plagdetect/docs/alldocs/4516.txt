What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids ?
Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately .
I disagree in censorshiping in libraries .
Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them .
First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age .
Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy .
Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop .
This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read .
I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors .
With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book .
But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy .
At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library .
So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now
