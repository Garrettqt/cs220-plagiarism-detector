Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries ?
No , I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it .
They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them .
If the person complains about a book , music , movies or anything then they should not go to the library .
I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain , they shouldn't be aloud in the library .
When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library .
I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside .
I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal .
When I was looking , I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians .
He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves .
He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave .
I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work , then eventually they got free .
My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries .
People that do not think they are offensive will read them .
If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book .
That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries .
