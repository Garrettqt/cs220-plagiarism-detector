Library Censorship Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive ' books removed from shelves .
Parent supervision , librarian supervision , and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive .
Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read .
If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid ' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more .
When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate , then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area .
The librarian's supervision is also an important priority .
Maybe they don't know the children's actual age , but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age , show them another book shelf .
Just like parents , librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy .
But , librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day , so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child , or something else that the child finds interesting .
The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive ' books shouldn't be removed from libraries .
Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read .
If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read , go to a different area .
Once again , I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries .
If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain ' then they should observe what books their child reads , trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read , and expect their child to have good common sense
