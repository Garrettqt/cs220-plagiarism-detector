I do not believe that books should be censored .
I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up .
The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight .
I 've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book .
If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see .
All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive .
I think that if they allow some commericials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display.I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult but who are we to say no you can not read that .
The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place .
If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place .
If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store .
The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music .
If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online .
There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you .
It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library .
Those are some valid points on why I believe that books , magazines , movies , and etc .
should not be censored .
If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library .
If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online .
If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store .
That is why I believe books should not be censored .
