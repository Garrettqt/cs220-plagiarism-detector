There are many diffrent people in this world , who have many diffrent oppions about books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies , that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves .
as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound .
there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks .
the live and breath scarry movies .
I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there .
i will read any book of listen to any type of music , it actualy widens my taste in certain materials .
i feel like everyone should try new things .
Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 .
and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children .
BUT @CAPS4 , books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends .
This is nonsince .
many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like .
otherwise your busines will fail .
