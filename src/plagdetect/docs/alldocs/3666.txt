Going to the library you would think of it as an family environment , wouldn't you ?
I know that when I think of the library I do not think or offenceive material that would make anyone upset .
Surprisingly many of the libraries do and I do not think that they should be alouded to , since it is not aimed just for adults .
Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they enjoy , but a five year old does not need to see a movie , a book , or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race .
These materials should not be able to sit apon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down .
The writers or the library owners wouldn't let there own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else child to read or watch it .
I 'm not the only one who thinks this , I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appericiate their loved ones finding these things and reading them .
The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life ; who knows what they will do or think when there are old enough .
Theses places are supposed to be an family place where you can go to get information not for someone to pick up on violence , drugs , racistism , and any other diragotori subjects .
Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these cruptied material ; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account .
I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches ; not only because small children could see them , but adults does not need to be reading , listening , or watching these things either .
If you would not want oyur child to why would anyone else want their child too ?
