Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools .
There @MONTH1 be a book that someone really wants to read , and they can not get it in their school's library .
A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries , because they are either too violent , or they have bad language in them .
If kids or parents are offended by these types of books , then they do not need to check them out .
There should not be censorship on books in schools .
There have been a lot of books , teachers view as being educational books , that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries .
Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read .
There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word , or a few violent scenes for them to read .
Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone , and touch them .
Banning books in libraries needs to change .
People should have the right to read what they want to read , even if the book or magazine comes from a school library .
There are books that are very good that have been banned .
'
@CAPS1 for @PERSON1 ' for example was banned in public schools for some reason .
This book is one of my top five favorite books , and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned .
This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age .
Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good .
Many peoples lives could be changed , touched , moved , etc ... due to a book .
Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life .
People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it .
