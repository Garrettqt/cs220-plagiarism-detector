Do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive ?
No , I do not believe that .
Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values .
I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back , or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene .
There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away .
You just don't listen to it or you don't read it .
If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you , then go right ahead .
It's good to defend yourself .
I remember when I was about @NUM1 , I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend .
And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1 .
He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names , but we tolerate him .
So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .
We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room .
@CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing , because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter .
@PERSON1 looks at us and smiles , then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter .
@CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it , but when he handed it to her she dropped it , looked up at him with tears in her eyes , and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man .
As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture .
@CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1 .
@PERSON1 says , ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl , she needs to learn how to take a joke . '
@CAPS4 mom takes me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he 'll be right up .
A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind .
I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady , and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop .
I looked at @PERSON1 and I said , ' @CAPS5 'd you give that to her ? '
@CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks ' and aids .
So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father .
@CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago .
Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that .
But I 'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson .
He should have just left her alone .
So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us .
We stayed there all weekend .
Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that , and she moved on with her life .
I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it
