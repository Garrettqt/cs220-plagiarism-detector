I do not believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive .
It is good to be unique , and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be , it is still factual and helpful in learning .
If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content . '
@CAPS1 repeats it's self , and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes , no matter how bad the subjects are , such as the @CAPS2 , and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south .
What about the @CAPS2 , when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7 .
@CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened .
There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2 .
Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject , it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened .
And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong , and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future .
The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2 .
The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A , but some people couldn't handle it as well as others .
In the south , most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt .
They didn't let them in their schools , in their clubs or churches , they were rude towards them , and most horrific of all , they lynched them .
There were a set of @PERSON1 called the ' @PERSON1 , ' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible .
If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them , they would remember it their whole life , and if that one picture truly bothered them , they their whole life growing up , they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical .
Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit , but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives .
Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them .
What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex ?
@CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is .
I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means , but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age , their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty , sex , and babies .
It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20 , or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors .
If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13 , when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves .
If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done , it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated .
Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them , just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different .
And it is wrong and inhuman
