Censorship in Libraries @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about .
You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves .
On the library shelves it contains books , music , movies , and magazines .
Some things are like what pictures it contains , launguage it contains , and what kind of advertising .
Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains .
I have seen some books , magazines , music , and movies have are cusswords .
Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like .
Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff .
Also another thing are advertisements .
Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco , such as its good for you to try .
Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand , and we think its cool to try it , but its not .
The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement , such as a picture of a drug leaf , or inscents .
It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college .
The last thing are pictures and scenes .
In movies , @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of .
In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either .
So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes , and innapropiate pictures .
Some things are like what pictures it contains , launguage it contains , and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is .
On the library shelves it contains books , music , movies , and magazines .
