Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book ?
Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas .
When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries .
I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it .
Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else ?
Banning books would go against what our country stands for .
How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read ?
Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves ; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book .
I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing , and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves .
Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem .
I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society .
There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library .
Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination .
Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity ?
