Everyone has different views on works of literature , wheather it be books , magazines , movies , or music .
If libraries were to removes this stuff from the shelves then they would be loosing business , they would be loosing children , and they would taking away the reason of it being on the shelves .
These libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they @MONTH1 not .
The people running the business @MONTH1 decide to take out older pieces of work that @MONTH1 offend younger people in this generation .
The stuff wrote , sang , or played in these things @MONTH1 harm these people but that is not what it is in there for .
The things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days , as in the slaves .
This would play a roll on children that use this library also .
If this literature was taken out , children @MONTH1 think that things have always been the way they are as they see it .
If these children grew up and were to see a book , hear a song , or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days , and how much it has changed , then they @MONTH1 never believe it because they were not taught as children .
As they are older , they @MONTH1 still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up .
These things are wrote to teach people and children about how things used to be , they are not used to harm people .
When people take these things harmful , they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when the wrote them .
Libraries should keep these peices of literature on their shelves , only to teach young people of what the world has came from and how their older relatives lived , and what they came from
