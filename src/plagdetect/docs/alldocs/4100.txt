Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2 , violance and some nudety .
This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf .
Its to inapprope for kids , see or even read what the movie case says .
There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures .
Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble .
Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me .
The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years .
But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude .
The nest thing is violance .
Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs .
Because I have lost alot of friends to guns .
I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area .
More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because , of movies and what people say in books and in magazines .
People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market .
People get these ideas because of movies .
Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools .
They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words .
Now the kids know how to say them .
Sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air .
My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs
