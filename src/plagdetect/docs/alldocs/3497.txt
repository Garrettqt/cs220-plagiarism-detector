'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf . '
@CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it .
Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf .
I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books .
If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history .
Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true .
If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language .
For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else .
For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language .
But I could read any book I wanted to .
It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights .
And then she states that their wont be any books left for us .
I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, on the shelfs .
Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children .
And no @CAPS1 their reading .
To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs .
