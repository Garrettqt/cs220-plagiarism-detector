Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today .
Yes , there will always be something you disagree with , but it's not hurting you so just ignore it .
Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them .
Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days .
I believe there is no harm in libraries , it is a place where you go to get all the information you can .
So why would you remove valuable information .
The library is a place for all people no matter who you are , how old or ugly .
Everyone can use the library for any reason , many times invloving school .
Personally I do not much use public libraries , but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book .
For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about .
For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is .
So why take that information away from me .
Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it .
I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from .
Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs .
Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome .
It is a place to get away from it all , I think they should leave them just how they are .
