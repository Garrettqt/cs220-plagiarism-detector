I don't think they should remove anything thats offensive from the library cause honestly , most of the books author publish have something offensive in @CAPS1 .
I'ts not the library's fault , if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them .
I 've been to the library and listened to music , watched movies , and even read magazines that have some offensive content in @CAPS1 , but if they weer to remove all the offensive content from the library , then the library would be half empty .
I 've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content thats not appropriate from the library , but why would @CAPS1 even matter if they can just ignore @CAPS1 and keep @CAPS1 away .
@CAPS1 honestly isn't a big deal when @CAPS1 comes to these type of problems .
I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agree's with me .
My mom said ' @CAPS1 would'nt be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored @CAPS1 ' .
Also the music that they have should stay their wether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to .
The movies that are made these days all have innapropriate content in @CAPS1 , wether its a rated @CAPS2 movie or not .
As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content , @CAPS1 should still be kept at the library and not removed .
I 'm sure alot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library .
If children end up listening to the offensive music , or watching offensive movies then think about @CAPS1 like this , they need to grow up someday .
If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content
