To start , if any materials in the library such as books , music , movies , or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves .
This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon .
People have all the freedom to read , listen or watch anything that is approperite to them .
I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others .
Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment .
It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information .
It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history .
Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy .
If you chose to pick a book , watch a movie , or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed , if you would like to read , watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it .
Therefore , i conclude that if any books , music , movies , or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves .
Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries .
It is for their own benifit , not for yours .
It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation .
Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background
