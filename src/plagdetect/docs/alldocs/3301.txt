Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 , @CAPS3 , my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion .
People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but , they need to keep them were there kids cant find them .
Kids in the world hear bad language , see fighting , and even see people get shot .
There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies , books , and music that childreen listen to , watch , or read .
I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything .
Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv .
But , if there kids wan na learn about things that happen thats not the greatest , then people should let them .
It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it .
Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it .
There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen .
Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors .
Having things censored ruins a lot of things , the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way .
I 'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but , it's something to look and think about .
People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored .
That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things .
So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored .
Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way .
Sincerely , @PERSON1
