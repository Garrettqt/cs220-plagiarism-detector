Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I 'm here to talk about why I thing we should have these certain materials in the libraries .
Why I think these materials should stay well because , For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for , for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look .
Even though you know its not there , but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for .
And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for .
I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials .
well i guess that about sums that up for me .
And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes .
What would you do ?
would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay .
