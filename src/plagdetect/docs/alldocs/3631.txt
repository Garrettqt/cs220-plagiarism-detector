Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible ?
I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books .
In my opinion it would be beneficial to students , parents , or teachers to get information on different topics .
As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they @MONTH1 not be familier with , and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic .
A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something , find an interesting read , or just relax .
If your going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about , it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic .
This would help students with reports , along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic .
If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library , then I think that person should just try and ignore the books .
I think this because I dont think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others , just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it .
Maybe the books are about drugs , sex , or violence , but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgable about the innappropriate , or offensive topics .
In conclusion , throwing books out and keeping a library censored , would be a mistake .
It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgable about different topics .
It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school , or even work
