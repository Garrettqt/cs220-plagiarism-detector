Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf .
You have to think about it from the other person's perspective , or put yourself in their shoes .
Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head , that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library .
Also in your everyday life .
One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things .
Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often .
I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit .
So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it .
Music should not be as much of an issue as books .
Music is something you listen to or you hear .
Books are things you read .
I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books .
Books is usally says it right there in black and white .
Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture .
So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life .
So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive
