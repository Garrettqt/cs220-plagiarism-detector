I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive , because to some people those books aren't found offensive .
People shouldn't let what is in books bother them .
The way I see @CAPS4 is , if the book offends you , then don't read @CAPS4 .
There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book , that to some people isn't offensive .
I agree that books that are offensive are bad , but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4 .
@CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything .
Like for instance , music .
if we had a library for @CAPS1 music , @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for .
Same thing with movies and magazines .
The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses .
Back to the point .
I 've never ran across an offensive book , and if I did , I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back .
Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive ?
Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway .
If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive .
Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad .
Books are for entertainment and fun , and they shouldn't be found offensive .
I 've said @CAPS4 before , and I 'll say @CAPS4 again .
If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be .
Music on the other hand , is offensive to many people .
I mean , let's face @CAPS4 , we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate .
They 're are a lot of offensive songs in the world , which I personally think shouldn't be around at all , and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse .
Music is a persuasive thing , and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2 , @CAPS4 could be bad .
That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4 , which persuades kids to do them , and no one wants their kids doing drugs .
I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries , @CAPS4's music , not books .
I 've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said .
books are books , they 're offensive to some people , and to some people , they 're not .
In the end , @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion
