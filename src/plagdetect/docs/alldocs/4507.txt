WE ALL DO N'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND , WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD TO THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK , MOVIE , MUSIC OR MAGAZINES .
PARENT DO N'T WANT TO COME HOME AN THERE CHILD LEARN A NEW WORD FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE HE/SHE JUST CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBARY , OR READING A MAGAZINE FROM THE LIBARY .
IT MIGHT MAKES YOUR CHILDREN ATTITUDE CHANGE PUTTING BAD INFLEUNCE ON YOUR KID BECAUSE OF A TRIP TO THE LIBARY .
SO THERE FOR THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A SECTION WHERE THEY PICK OUT THERE BOOK AND THEY SHOULD N'T BE ABLE TO CHECK OUT THE CENSORSHIP BOOK .
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .
