There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion .
But , other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it .
Censorship , taking books , movies , magazine , etc .
off the shelves so a person can not read or watch them , is a very positive thing .
In many cases censorship is a great thing .
It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age .
In libraires , the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying .
Like books , music , movies , and magazines should be censored , too .
Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head .
This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing .
Movies should also be censored .
When I was little , my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age .
I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child .
On the other hand , my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted .
She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read .
Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things .
In my experiences with this type of material , I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books .
Although , censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them , the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs .
Thousands of books are censored each year .
Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have different opinions on .
Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern
