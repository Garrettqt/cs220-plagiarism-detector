People find things offensive everyday .
It is just a matter of life .
Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons , but they really can't control it from happening .
It is just something that has occured for thousands of years .
And people have slowly began to deal with it .
So therefore , i believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone , because taking it down could offend someone else .
What i 'm really trying to get across is that no matter what , not everyone will be happy .
Life is filled with mixed society and emotions , so not everyone will agree on the same thing .
Also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material .
Because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch , read , or listen to it .
Thus being said , i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum .
Such as racism , it seems as though rasicm impacts alot of the country still today .
And will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1 .
In conclusion , i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive .
Because like i said everyone deals with it at one point , and not everyone can be happy .
And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1 , @CAPS1 , ect , rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about .
And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye .
For we are all the same , but yet , still broken up among looks and culture
