I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf .
some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings .
But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read .
many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them .
There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people .
but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys .
In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book .
and have different books in different place's .
like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section .
I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's .
They should have a different store for certain books .
And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying .
There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read , and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want .
Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book .
But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older , i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read .
by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer
