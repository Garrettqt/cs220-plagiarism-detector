Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in librarys ?
Well here's my perspective .
I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism , violence , and etc .
One , because there are young children that read books throughout the library , and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect .
can be offensive to others .
How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that ?
That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age .
So that's my perspective on it
