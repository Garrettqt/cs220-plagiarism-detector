I will be talking about , do think books , music , or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive .
In my opinion I don't think books , music , movies , or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people .
Because not all people have the same interests .
First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended .
But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it .
But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves .
Another example can be a book .
what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended .
They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend .
But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend .
The same way goes for a magazine also .
What if a person gets offended at an advertizement .
A person likes it and returns it , then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person .
In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it .
they shouldn 've look at the item in first place .
