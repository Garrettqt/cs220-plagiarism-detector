Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 , I think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive .
People at libraries fight over a book .
They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book .
If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone .
People in library fight over a sigle book .
I think who ever gets there first should get the book , but that just me .
If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library .
And that is why we have fights over a book .
The next time you are in a library think frist before you act .
Ask yourself ' @CAPS3 they get ther before me ? '
.
The library should have more that one copy of a book .
Lets say ' @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 ' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book .
Now the lat move of ' @ORGANIZATION1 ' is coming out this @DATE2 ( @DATE1 ) and people what the last book to read .
The kids what it , but there is one book .
So what do you do ?
Get more copies of the book .
This is why libraries should have more than one copy .
If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums .
If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights .
You don't what to fight in a library ( look @CAPS4 @NUM1 ) .
Now if it was me , I will let someone have it that whan it .
So , libraries need more than one copy .
In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf , the book should be taken off if found offensive .
There fighting for a book and you don't whant that .
The libraries needs more than one copy of a book , so they will not fight over it .
If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums .
So , think before yo act .
It can be found offensive at time .
Sincesly , @PERSON1
