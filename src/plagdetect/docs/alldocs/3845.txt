I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just seperate the things in sections .
That way there would be no problems .
I mean , why change something if only a few people doesn't like something ?
Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict .
Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want , @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all .
So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions .
