I do not think they should be removed at all .
They show a persons opinion on something .
We can't just disregard it because we dont like what its saying .
Thats like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look .
Or just anyone that we dont like how they look .
I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship .
I @MONTH1 not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would .
You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be .
I could get a book removed because it offends me .
Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me .
People are offened by little things and should jut except the fact that other people have different opinions .
It's just like judging a person for their race .
They have differnt morales and values and you can't just change that in a person .
Like if you don't like this article just don't read it .
Don't say other people can't read it because of your views .
I don't think there should be censorship .
