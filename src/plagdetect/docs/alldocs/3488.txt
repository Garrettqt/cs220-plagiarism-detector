With new things coming out these days , I , @PERSON1 , believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects .
I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books , magazines , or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion .
I would like more organization for certian things , I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book .
These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people , but sometimes can offence other people .
So , with this way I would really like if there was a scale , or organization of books .
So with that , people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like .
If there is a scale factor of these books , music , magazines , or movies , you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories .
Even though , I , personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization , it would atleast worn people of these things .
If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed .
I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better .
This would be a lot of work but , thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself .
I would not like any books removed from libraries .
This is because if you start taking one out of the library , that my offence someone , I believe you will start taking out more than one .
With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all .
So please , please think about organizing the books , magazes , movies , music , and more so then this will not happen in the future .
Thank you for your time to read this , I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more .
Also , maybe publish some too , into the newspaper .
