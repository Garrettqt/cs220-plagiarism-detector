I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf , depending on how they are offensive .
If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs .
Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs .
People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it .
I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs .
I think this because , children can read this and then , they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races .
I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others .
Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others .
People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others .
It could cause problems for the libraies also , doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material .
Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close .
I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf .
The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive , because alot of people look at them like they are trash .
It makes a bad impression on some people .
Its rude for it to be there .
It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads .
I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf .
It can cause many problems with others .
It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore .
Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way .
