I belive certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information .
I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on , freedom of speech and equality for everyone .
If we started removing books , movies etc .
from out of our libraries for being offensive , where would we draw the line between offensive and not ?
To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture , would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles .
Now , let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place .
People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think , wouldn't you ?
.
Plus , the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach , they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom .
In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries .
