From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content .
I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive .
It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it .
I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place .
My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended .
I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it .
Why should your opinion speak for everyone else .
Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless .
I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard .
My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library .
They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it .
Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates .
