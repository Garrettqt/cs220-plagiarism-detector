Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people .
It could have language , racial slurs , or anything else one might find offensive .
In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose .
These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes .
Some things did happen , such as the @LOCATION1 , that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it , it happened and we can't change it .
This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place , so they will not do it .
Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word .
They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word .
I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out , but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene .
Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie .
A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal .
What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing , it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time .
As for books in libraries , we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young , innocent child does not wonder across them .
Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well .
In conclusion , offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves , just mabye to a different location .
Let the people read what they want to read .
