Moving @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 In @CAPS4 !
When you enter a library or a book store of course you will find @CAPS3 that you like and dislike .
You 're opinion @MONTH1 not be the same as someone else .
Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going .
People have diffrernt looks about different @CAPS3 in this way of @CAPS4 .
You are going to come across good @CAPS3 , bad thing , happy @CAPS3 , sad @CAPS3 , @CAPS3 you agree about , and @CAPS3 you disagree about .
I believe that books , music , movies , magazines , or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody .
The reason I state that is because if any of those items offened one person they might not be offensive to another .
Different people have different intrest in many different @CAPS3 .
So therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves .
Especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically .
Speaking from personal experience there were many times i felt offened about certain @CAPS3 .
I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a @CAPS4 that has not been born yet .
Killing a child that has not experince the thing you have is not right .
But some sometime the way i can feel can be alot different to other people .
So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do .
That comes with voicing your own opinion .
You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling .
If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy .
Think about the @CAPS2 situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you .
It will be alot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it .
@CAPS3 will be much easier and less @CAPS2 if we sometimes deal with the difficullt @CAPS3 in @CAPS4
