Yes , I think they should be removed from the shevles .
Some books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
are overated and young children go to visit the library .
They should have a shelve for kids , tennagers and grown-ups .
Everybody should have they own section for their age group .
Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing , like hanging out in the street , hang with older kids .
They watch inappropriate movies , when they should be watching something educational .
The music they have out now days , children shouldn't listen to it .
It's to much cursing and violent .
More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things .
There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too .
I don't think they should read about killing or sex .
I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them .
Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors , they been through everything you doing or trying to do now .
So just talk to them and be real about things .
I think they should be certain magazines in the library .
Young children beat theyselves up , because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines .
They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be .
Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt .
Then , young men want to have big mucles and be buff .
In conclusion , I don't think books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
should be removed from the shelves .
There should be a shelve for young kids , tennages and adults .
The music that is played on the radio now days , shouldn't be on there .
Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach .
There are certain things tennagers should watch and read .
