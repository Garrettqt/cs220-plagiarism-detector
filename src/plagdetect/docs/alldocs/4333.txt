Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
I do not think it should matter weather we have music , movies or magazines in the library .
Some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music .
I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there , if it is not bothering them it should not bother anybody else .
I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music .
it does not bother me when they do this .
It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book .
There is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library .
It is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines , or when there music is turned up way to loud .
Other than that I do not think we should keep those types of materials in the librarys .
I am a reader my self and I like to read in peace .
So I like to listen to my music while I am reading .
I also like to read magazines every once and awhile .
It is real relaxing to me .
Those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library
