Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring .
Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books , and wishing that they were all more interesting .
Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours , you get a glimpse of a very interesting title .
Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page .
Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it ?
Profanity , nudity , and crude humor , as well as many other things , are all over the media , including books .
Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply can not watch , listen to , or read certain things .
The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see , hear , or read these things , other than , 'it is bad , and I said no . '
If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things , the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things .
Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things , but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't .
And if a child is too young to see , hear , or read certain things , than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent .
Censorship , in my opinion , should not be done by libaries , movie producers , television programs , and record companies , it should be done by the parents of a child .
