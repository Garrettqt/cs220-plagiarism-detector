In my personal opinon I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay .
It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it .
Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you .
You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive , but you have to think in other peoples shoes .
Just becaus you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is .
That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults .
Same concept with movies , magazines , music , and etc .
Take this for example .
I was walking through the library when I saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1 , and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it .
I think that they should throw this book away .
Now lets think does that sound fair .
Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone .
What about this , lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away .
Doesn't seem to fair does it .
In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like .
I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinon .
