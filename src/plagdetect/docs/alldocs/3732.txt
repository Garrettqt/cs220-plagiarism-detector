I believe that some materials should not be on the selfs , but not removed.They should have a room with everything that someone could offened anyone.Some books ; music , movies , magazines , and etc .
should not be totally removed from a public library .
I have seen a little kid pull a adult book of the self.The mother got very mad at the library for having it so low , on the self.I can understand some books being in the library.They should have all the adult book and etc .
on the higher selfs so the little kids can not reach them.The library should have a room for only kids , and teenagers books ; magazines , music , movies and etc .
The kids should not be aloud in parts of the library that are to vilont , or sexual.The library should also have a room for all the adult movies and books with a locked door , along with the kid room.If the library does not have enough money for the rooms , they can atleast put all of the adult stuff on a top self or higher self .
I believe that some materials should not be on the shelfs , but not removed from the library.Because , someone might need that book to research something for school or a job.It could also take someones history out of the library if it is removed.I mean there is a reason the book ; movie , magazine , music , or etc .
was made.There is a reason that the material is there.Also the parents can help the library , by keeping a closer eye on their kids.Watch what the grab off the self.The parent can even have a friend or neighbor watch the children while the parent goes to the library so the kids wont see anything the shouldn't .
I believe everything i have wrote here is the truth about the way things should be in a public library.The adult stuff should be higher up.If a parent doesnt like it they can leave their kid at home , or not go to that library anymore .
