The books , magazines , music , and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves .
They still have good information that someone other than you @MONTH1 want to know .
If you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity .
If you remove books then if someone needs one for a reseach paper that they have to do they will not have the nessisary resouces to do the paper , and at the same time the person with the paper @MONTH1 feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person wont have the books that they want .
If they want the book taken off of the shelf , because of inopropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them .
I wasw at the library and there was a woman getting upset , because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have .
The , book and the movie , that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't suposed to get them .
So the woman would be the one that would probibly want to take them off of the shelves , but it wasn't the libraries fualt that he wasn't where he was supposed to be .
The products should stay on the shelves , because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place .
If they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it .
If there are resons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to you the products .
The products should stay on the shelves so that the people who need , or just want to use the products can use the products .
