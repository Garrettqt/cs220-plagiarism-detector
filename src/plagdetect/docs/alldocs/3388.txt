@CAPS1 is the freedom of speech to be able to read , right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.I think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf .
Like I said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen .
But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone .
we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country .
such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth .
Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch .
From these things @CAPS1 shows us how to act , dress , feel , and treat other people @CAPS1 is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day @CAPS1 could effect you .
