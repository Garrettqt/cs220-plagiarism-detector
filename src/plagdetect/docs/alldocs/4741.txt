I belive that offensive books should be taken off the shelf .
Some books are offensive and some are inaproprate .
The libarian could get rid of the books , so the little kids can ' @CAPS2 get the inaproprate book .
Movies that are rate ' @CAPS1 ' and above should be removed .
Anything that has an ' A ' rating should be removed , the libaries are a public place to rent and return , buy or sell , or to trade movies , books , and etc .
Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health .
Anything inaproprate could be censored by a black marker .
The old libuary I used to go to , had all the slang , cus-words , and etc , all marked out with a black sharpie .
Some of the movies were thrown out of the rating ' @CAPS2 ' to all the above , the magazines , had marks on the pages also , censored the slag in the magazine .
The music at the libuary was blocked , some music was not blocked , and the rest were the censored part of the songs .
The librares should do the same like the old one did .
