How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library ?
I , along with many other students , @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous , so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves .
Otherwise , a demolished love of reading , crushed individuality , and separated population @MONTH1 be born .
Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1 , many books and series are being taken out of libraries ' collections due to people in society finding them offensive .
In this case , the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs ; therefore , some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned .
Fortunately , none of the libraries I visit , with their eclectic collections , had banned this series , or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now .
All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading , like @PERSON2 did for me , so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation , but the futures of all .
If this censorhip was to be allowed , who is to say what all could be censored ?
Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned ?
It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it .
This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties .
Disagreements could turn into debates , and those could turn into fights .
It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs , and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4 be wrong .
For instance , it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3 ; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten ; a woman taking away men's voting rights .
Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions , and disrespect is never a beneficial thing .
Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not , so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality .
Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs , the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull .
Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special ; additionally , free thought is a right all people should have .
If someone was to limit the mental , literary stimulants that are out in the world , the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease .
To conclude , censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality , personal beliefs , and the overall joy of reading a good book .
Just because one might not believe in what a story says , it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden .
No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library , so if someone is offended , simply do not read it .
So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries ?
Disrespected ?
That is how I @CAPS4 feel
