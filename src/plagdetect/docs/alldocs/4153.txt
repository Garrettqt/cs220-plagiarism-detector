I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff .
Someone might have wanted to get that book .
I don't think it would be right to take it away .
When I was in sixth grade , I was in a foster home that I hated .
They would not let me listen to the music I liked .
They thought it was bad for kids to listen to .
All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that .
My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil ' in me .
They would make me read the bible everynight .
They tried to shove religion down my throat .
I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious .
They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her .
Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch .
When parents are that strict , it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do .
If you don't let someone watch , listen to , or read what they want , then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves .
They would not be able to show off what they really like .
They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right .
Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like .
