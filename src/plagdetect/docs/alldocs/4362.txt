Do you think that something should be taken off the book shelf just it affended someone or you disliked it ?
I dont just cause you dont like something or you dont approve of the reading material dosent mean it should be taken away .
If it was like that @DATE1 than there wouldnt be any reading material or books or magazines .
In my opinion if affends you in some way or another than dont read it .
Plane and simple .
Because im sure that theres thosands of books , magazines , news papers .
ect , thats affends alot of people everyday .
I dont mean to be harsh in any way , thats just the way I feel .
This is only my opinion.that how I feel about this situation .
