Libraries are for children , and adults of all ages .
Because all people have different views on life , different beliefs , and different feelings , @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone .
There are also different genres that people enjoy reading .
Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy , while others like to read action books or mysteries .
Today , libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials .
They have kids , fiction , informational , and many more .
They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines .
But , if there are magazines , books , or movies , that should be viewed only by certain ages , the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located .
On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is .
Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines ?
This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4 .
@CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4 .
Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4 .
Once , when i was visiting the library , there was a man in the check out line , right before me .
@CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out .
When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet , old , lady at the front desk , what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books .
She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one .
As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked , ' @CAPS1 did you like your book , @CAPS2 ? '
@CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected .
@CAPS4 was completly inappropriate . '
As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book .
This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book .
I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about .
They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books , magazines , or movies .
Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there , but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous .
Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities .
Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive ?
No one makes those people read those books , its by their choice .
Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4
