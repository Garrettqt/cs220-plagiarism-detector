Books , music , movies , and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study , something that everyone should have access too .
If someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements .
Many people will still find these books or other recources interesting .
If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so .
Radio stations play songs that talk about sex , drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things .
Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life , and most of the bad things said are cut out .
Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes .
So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person
