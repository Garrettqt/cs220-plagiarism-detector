I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended .
People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that .
I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life .
Cartman from the tv show @LOCATION1 is the most offensive characters on that show .
He uses every offensive language known to mankind .
He makes fun of all the racees , he says he hates everyone equally .
But still you can't stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen .
It is also like trying to get rid of racecism .
That is what I think about finding something offencive .
