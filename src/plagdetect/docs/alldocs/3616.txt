In this persuasive essay i 'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs , and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that .
I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries .
My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs .
I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future .
My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo , because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others .
I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive .
Also if we do , we might as well not even have a library , because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building , because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's , books , and movies .
People hear cuss words probably everyday , whether its at school or home .
So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them .
I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book .
Scary movies are not real and some books too .
There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies , but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies .
To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs , I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries , beacuse it will hurt others , and theres just no need in it
