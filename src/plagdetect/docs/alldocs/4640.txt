Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive ?
I dont think that is right .
Thats just what one person thinks and other people I 'm sure won't think the same way .
Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book .
Also with music , movies , and magazines , well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library ?
A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need , then how are they supposed to get their work done ?
Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet , but we are going to have to learn about it sometime , so why not now ?
Taking away music ?
kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble .
So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it .
Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them .
As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there .
So i think taking books , music , magazies , and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do .
Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should .
I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore .
