To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say .
If the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out .
having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not .
Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts .
Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department .
