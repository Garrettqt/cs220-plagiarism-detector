I somewhat agree with taking out books , music , movie , magazines , or any other material that could be offensive to someone , because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriote for children to read .
I think it just depends on the topic , maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other , so people should choose wisely what they read .
It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libaries because people take different interset in different topics , so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriote but another person think that book is fine , it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves .
But something that I do disagree with in books or magizines that is inappropriote is pictures and comics , because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book , movie , or a magazine that has that type of content in it .
But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it .
So it depends on what type of things are in the book , movie , or magazine .
Basically it's up to the person , if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldnt look into it
