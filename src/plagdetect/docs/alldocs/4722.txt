In our socioty , a lot of people and places take offense to certain things .
In my opinion , librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive .
People have the right to pick something up , over look it , and decide wheither it's offensive or not .
If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it , then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made .
I agree , somethings are offensive , but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it , then dont let it bother you .
I believe that music is a way that people express themselves .
I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store .
If the material is to graphic for children or some people , then don't listen to it .
If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read , listen , or watch them , then maybe you just should do it .
