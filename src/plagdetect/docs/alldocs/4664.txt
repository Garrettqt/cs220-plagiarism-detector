I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library .
If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries .
If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it ?
I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library .
If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it .
I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store , but why would they waste the money in buying the book .
The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books .
Everyone has different views also .
If anyone could remove books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library .
A book is a book .
Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries ?
If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries .
There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public .
