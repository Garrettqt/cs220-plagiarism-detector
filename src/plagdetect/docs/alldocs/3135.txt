Okay , to me , people are way to moral in the modern world , i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself .
Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be .
I know that somethings are a little , risque , but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution .
Your probably asking yourself , how in the world can this be a 'better solution ' ?
Lets talk about children and this content , if you get this out there quicker and subtlely , the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age .
If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal , such as ; fines , misdemenors , respect , reputation , and even some time in jail .
Tell the kids about murder , drugs , sex , and crimes in general , they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older .
Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community , yea i know what your thinking , why not do that ?
If more people in your community are nicer , when a real threat comes , whos gon na help ?
The @CAPS1 ?
who knows , it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around , even longer if your in a city .
In that time , some one could have died , been robbed and that same criminal gone .
So , if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on , people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical .
Anyways , what im trying to say is , if you take this away from us , people will become weaker , if you let it stay , people will learn from it and use it for good
