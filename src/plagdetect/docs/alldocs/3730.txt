Why censor things ?
When there's always going to be someone out there wanting to read a book or magizine that others think should be censored .
If this visious circle would continue then we wouldn't have any books left at all to read .
Theres lots of things out there that some people dont like but that doesn't give them the right to take it off the self .
Then by doing that and taking it off the self just because they didnt think it was an apropriate book .
Will leave someone with nothing to read now .
If the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things .
Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines doesn't make them inaproprieate .
It needs to be labled on the book that it has it in there .
If you see the mark and you dont want to look at it then you dont have too .
We need to code books for different ages .
Then parents could be happy if there little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are .
Then if parents give permission then children could read books that were ment for older kids or adults .
Even though im not the biggest fan of reading but i will sometimes pick up a book that has things for me to learn in it about an engine .
I dont think that people should be able to restrict anything and take it off the selves everyone has there own right to read the book or watch the movie , etc .
But children are different because they dont need to learn all those things at an early age .
So parents can pick what they can read .
but if your an adult you should be able to read , listen , or watch whatever you want to .
