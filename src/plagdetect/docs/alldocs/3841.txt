Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves .
For many of years people would come to the libaray for them .
some @MONTH1 be volger as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive , but there should be a age check out law .
as well as being with in consideration for this centerys ways .
There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world .
They love to pain of others .
Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves , there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read .
Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things , but that lyes with the parents .
If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book .
if we had all of this then there would not be any more problems .
it would be a nice controled libaray .
so in conclustion this is the way to go .
