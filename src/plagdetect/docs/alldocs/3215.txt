Do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , should be removed off of the shelves if they are offensive ?
My personal opinion is that they should not be removed .
unless they are so inapropreate that children should not be avle to see .
That is my opinion because if readers go into the library and find an offinsive book to us might not be offinsive to him/her and his/her standards .
And if it is offensive to him/her so what he/she is the one checking it out so he/she obviously knos what he/she is getting in to so there for we should not remove books off the shelves if they are offinsive , because offinsive to one is not offinsive to the other .
well actually my opinion goes half and half because if the movievs and librarys are inapropreate then aldults should be the only ones to buy them .
That is my personal opinion many others @MONTH1 have different opinions on this subject but i just think every thing should just stay on the shelves .
And movies sold to aldults and aldults only .
