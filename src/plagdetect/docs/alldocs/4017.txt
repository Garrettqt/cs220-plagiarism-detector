There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf .
First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be .
Second , no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do .
If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere .
There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many differnt things from anyone else .
If a person were to remove a book , and another person wanted to get that book , but found that a person requested it to be removed that person whouldnt be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive .
So what if a book found offensive was removed ?
there are much worse things on television .
Cartoons are more violent then what most books are , more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using wemon , money , and fame to lure people .
Most of the time they are not meant for children , a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product , or some kind of adult enjoyment , they are part of life .
No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child 'safe ' , just will not work these days .
No matter hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next vorner , be it a billboard , a poster , a movie cover , or a band , someone will always find something offensiv and teach their children to do the same but , just beacause someone @MONTH1 not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's childer will not eiuther
