I believe that everyone should be free to read , listen or watch what they choose to .
Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow .
I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themself .
If it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian .
Books , movies , and music are forms of entertainment .
People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves , and there is nothing wrong with entertainment .
Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair .
If it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age , and maturity .
Regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else , such as the tv or the internet .
The public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on education about somthing .
I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read , and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there .
If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it .
If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent .
anything publically exposed in a book , magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want rather elders ' agree to it or not .
Nudity , perfanity , violence , and provocative materialare in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of kepping it from children or people its apart of everyday livng .
