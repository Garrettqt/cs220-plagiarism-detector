I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves .
I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive .
I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them .
Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book .
Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading .
There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing .
People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence .
And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive .
If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well .
A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button .
Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material .
Some people might enjoy material that is offensive .
If material is removed alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted .
There would be alot of complaints , and problems .
And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited ..
The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have .
Many people will be satasified , and most people will be happy
