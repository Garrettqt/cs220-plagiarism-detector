Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you ?
Would you want your children reading , watching , or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them ?
I don't think no parent wants that .
Think about it , how do children have access to things like that ?
Is it all around or do children go and find it ?
Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be protected from bad materials .
Most of the time after school , children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside .
Inside of their house they have access to televison , computers , and music .
They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside ?
Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere .
Nothing is censored like it was back in the day .
Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive , just as long as they sell .
That's not the way it suppose to be at all , everybody should want best for the children and young teens .
People wonder why their is violence , bad attitudes , crimes , etc.
, because all the stuff we have access to .
Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries .
It's sad that type of material is available in a school , but thats how the generation is today .
In a library only certain things should be done .
Reading , using computers , working at a table .
Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games , or listen to music with bad words in it , or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine .
Library should be a place for learning , doing work , and reading .
If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem .
Censorship is much needed everywhere , it would help out a lot
