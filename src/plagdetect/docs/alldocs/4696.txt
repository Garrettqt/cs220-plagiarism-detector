Hi , my name is mason and i 'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc .
People have differnt views on differnt things .
Books , books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while .
Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while .
Music doesn't really teach you anything , it relaxs you in differnt ways .
Some people might learn from listening to music but i 'm not one of those peole .
It influnce you to get movited , say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it , well some music can get you hyped up for that game .
When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it , to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies .
They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know .
Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too , and that is what I like about magazines and movies .
Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information , the ones that do help out alot .
So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books , movies , and magazine do help you to a certian point .
It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too
