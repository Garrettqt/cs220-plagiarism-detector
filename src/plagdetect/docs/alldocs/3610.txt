Offensive books do belong in the library , just in a completely different area , away from the children .
If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library , there would be none left .
So , since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't , who's to say what can and can't be in the library ?
When I was little , my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1 .
I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others .
My @CAPS1 did the same thing , but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't .
Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like ' @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 ' , and ' @PERSON1 ' .
Even at home , everyone's opinion is very different .
For instance , when it comes to music at my house ; @CAPS1 likes country , @CAPS7 likes metal , my brother likes alternative , my unlcle likes rock , and I like a combonation of all of it .
That just does to show how different people have different opinions ; some more strict than others .
If we relied on peoples ' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense , there would be nothing in it
