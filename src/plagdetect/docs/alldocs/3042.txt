I @CAPS1 ' @CAPS2 think that books should be censored .
There are no books , besides maybe math books , that @CAPS1 ' @CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people .
Books are an important part of the learning system .
If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1 ' @CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 .
@CAPS4's that simple .
there is no need to over react to words on paper .
Besides there are more important issues at the moment .
While being offended by a book is bad , we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that .
People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example .
A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose .
One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through .
As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book .
Censorship causes blidness .
What I mean is , if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive .
All men are created equal , right ?
So they 'd have to censor the book .
If a book offends you that much then listen up , @CAPS1 ' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 !
Just because a book is offensive to you doesn ' @CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone .
sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1 ' @CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them .
The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I 've mentioned , then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper .
