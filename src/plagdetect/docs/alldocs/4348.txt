I disagree with library censorship .
Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas .
If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read .
If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate .
In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things .
Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly , children should not always escape , or use reading to hide from real life , but occasionaly they need too .
I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things .
If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers .
Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations .
If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life .
No one likes boring people , and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination ?
It is impossible !
In recent online polls , parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life .
By reading , these children can easily expand their vocabularies .
With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease .
In conclusion , If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read .
Children need books to provide an escape , to expand their imaginations , and to help them in school and life .
Do not let libraries censor books !
