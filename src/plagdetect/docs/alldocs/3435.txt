This statment is not right .
Peolpe should be alound to read what ever they went or linst to or watch what ever movie they went .
When someone read somthing thats bad they @MONTH1 or not like it .
So people should not take away books , movies , and music that are bad .
One thing that peolpe should have a choose of what they read and other stuff .
Books some people like reading bad stuff beacuse they enjoy it .
If the person do not like it they should put back and find somthing else to read .
Now movies are a lot of fun to watch .
But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive sence or not .
And the age thing yay you should watch a movie with andult if your to young .
Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be takn off the shelves .
Becasue if you dont like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people thats bad music when it could be some great music .
Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines .
Its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines .
if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house .
So people should not take off the shelves are books , movies , and music but they can take away magzines.People like the books and stoffe that have bad stofe in them .
And there should be no taking off the shevels .
Thats what i think of if somone toke somthing off the shelves .
