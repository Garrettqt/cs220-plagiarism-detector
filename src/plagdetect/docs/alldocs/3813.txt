Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library ?
My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material .
Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic .
Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life .
So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some , because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books , music , videos , video games , writing , or movies .
We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate .
So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide ?
My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting .
So please don't censor books from our public library , we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words .
My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended .
