I think books that have nudity , curse words , or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good .
They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older .
They just arent appropriate .
No childeren should know about drugs , sex , or epspecially gang violence .
Its stuff they should never even find out about .
So i think we should take them books off the shelf , if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy .
