In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library .
If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf .
The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person , no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book , music , movies , magazines , etc , are offensive to them .
Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out .
Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf , they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf .
In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books .
so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase .
you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book , but those people will just have to deal with it .
The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also , the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice .
The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library .
In short my veiw of book censorship is that , the library will choose the books that go into the library .
To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries .
Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them
