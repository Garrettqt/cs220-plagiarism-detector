I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely .
I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults .
I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they 're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to .
I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life .
If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d .
or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book .
Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse .
Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children .
Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly .
If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission .
I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it .
So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit .
