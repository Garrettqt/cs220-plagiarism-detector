I belive that certain materials such as books , movies , magazines , etc .
should be removed from public libraries .
What if a young child were to stumble across an innapropriate magazine ..
They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions .
There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children .
I think that they should either be placed more appropriatly or removed completely .
Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others , but if read , the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts .
Personally , I think that most fictional books are intertainment only .
They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part .
If someone reads them as offensive , they might just be taking it the wrong way .
Most Libraries have areas sectioned of for adults only but they aren't monitored .
So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material ?
They wouldn't have the slightest clue .
I think that in today's society , most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot , so why limit them to what they already know about ?
There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines .
Shouldn't they be banned too ?
The world is exposed to offensive material everyday .
We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way .
But young children don't know better , so there is no gaurentee that they won't take ideas from inaprpropriate viewings and use them .
So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves .
