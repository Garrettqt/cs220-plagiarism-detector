I blieve that any book or movie that is in the the library is in the library for a good reason .
The world is full with things that will hurt and make a perosn feel bad about their self , and there is things in the world that will make you feel like you on top of the world .
Yes , there is things that children can see and what they are not suppost to see , and those things are mostly likely not expost to the student until they are at a muture and a responiable age .
Life is full of things and as children grown up they are going to be teach , show things that parent thinks that is uncomfortable .
Such as : Books that show people with disoders , a books about romance , movies with cussing and sex scenes in the movies , violence , some parnet don ' @CAPS1 even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek .
Which I find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life .
On the other hand , if your child is doing things that they shouldn ' @CAPS1 be doing then okay .
Take acting .
I also agree that a children @NUM1 shouldn ' @CAPS1 be thought sex and show either what female have and what boys have on their body .
Their mind shouldn ' @CAPS1 even be set on that .
Books , movies , @CAPS1.v shows shouldn ' @CAPS1 be remove because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older .
