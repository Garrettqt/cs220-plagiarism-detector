In libraries , is censorship truly needed ?
I believe there should be some censorship to some extent .
Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things .
I mean , they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I 've been in .
But even when they do sort the books , music , and magazines by topic , there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well .
I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother .
I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section , ' so I ventured forth to places I 've never been before .
Any isle of books was open to anyone , I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand .
Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways , butt I still looked through them all .
I mean , it was something very new to me ; almost like an adventure .
Then , I came across the music .
There were so many inappropriate titles , cover-arts , and even names of bands .
But this perked my curiosity .
I remember thinking to myself , 'were books this way too ? '
I soon found out yes , they were .
There were even doctor books with graphic images .
The worst were books with cuss words that I found .
Innocence in the library was gone .
I think libraries should have a different section for older , more mature people ; not including children .
Some people loves books , and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures .
Libraries need to realize that .
I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book , at the wrong time .
In conclusion , I think libraries should have at least some censorship .
I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me , but I think there should be something done about it
