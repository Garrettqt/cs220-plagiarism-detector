I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item .
I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else .
If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE ' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice .
Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing .
That is what I believe in
