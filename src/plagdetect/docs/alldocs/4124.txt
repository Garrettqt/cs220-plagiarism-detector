I dont think so becuase what if that is all the person likes to read .
They could put all the bookes in to diffrent sections so that littel kids wont be learning words they shouldnt know wright now .
the librarian could also make it where you have to be a sertaint age to cheak out a book .
There are a bunch of ways to orginze them in to sectoins like make a kids section , a teenager section , and even an adult section .
But i dont think the should take the out of the libary for good , becuse there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them .
just becuase ther are some bad words in abook does not mean the book is bad
