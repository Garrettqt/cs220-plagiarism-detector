In my personal opinion , I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books , music , magazines , or movies be romoved or edited more carefully .
Most parents , including mine , expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times , and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable .
In bookstores or even libraries , they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate .
We encourage and even push kids to read , but we can't even say , pick any book you want .
These books @MONTH1 have foul language , gang violence , or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin .
There are many types of music out in the real world .
Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite .
In my opinion , you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it .
There are different cd's , cassate tapes , or even records , that you can buy .
Yes , I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio .
You don't have to purchase that cd , and you can always ride with no music on .
Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes .
Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair , or @LOCATION1's next top model .
Quite frankly , I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions .
Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs , alcohol , or winning the lottory .
You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely .
People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it .
Whether it be in writing , singing , or pictures , you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate .
This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it .
If you don't want to hear it , don't listen .
If you dont want to see it , don't buy it .
Its quite simple
