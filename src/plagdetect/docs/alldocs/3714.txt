Yes , I do believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if thery are found offensive .
The reason why I think some things shuld be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things .
Parents don't always go with there children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get .
At school libraries they really dont have bad things they only have school approte things .
But the public library has alot of different things and than a school library .
Therefore those are my reaons why i believe certain materials should be removed .
