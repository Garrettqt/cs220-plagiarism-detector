I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people .
A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers .
As far as I'm concerned , books are creativity in text-form .
Creativity is a large part of life , and without it , we would all be the same .
There is at least one book for every person in the world , and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter , there is a book that will interest you .
It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive ' content .
With different personalities comes different writers .
With different writers comes different books .
With different books comes different readers .
There are a lot of people out there who like to read .
What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves ?
Books are written for two reasons : allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors .
I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book , that book should be available to anyone and everyone .
