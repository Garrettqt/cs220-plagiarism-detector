Yes , I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone .
First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended .
Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library .
And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area .
A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them .
People go to the library to read , study and to have a quiet time .
And the people that go to use the library for a resourse , should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book , movie or magazine , because of what the autor says in the writeing .
People might get offended and stop going to the library .
Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library .
If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it , but if the book is offensive to someone else , he should be asked to remove the book .
And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it .
Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area .
I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature , music , movies etc ...
In libraries .
Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries , but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed .
So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries .
Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended .
The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay .
Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area
