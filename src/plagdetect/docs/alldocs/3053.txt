Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of ?
A movie , book , magazine , music , or even something on @CAPS1 ?
It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material , but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song , movie , or @CAPS1 show ?
I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it , and it goes against one of our rights , freedom of speech .
In the world we live in today , if you take something away from someone like their favorite book , its going to bring out some violence between some people .
Look back into our history , we are a country full of rebels .
That is how @CAPS3 even came to be .
So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it .
There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things , so we will never be able to get rid of it completly .
If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights , freedom of speech .
Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others , but it's not like we have a right to get rid it .
It's not like there is any book , magazine , or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by .
If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything .
So what is the point we all will never all agree on something , we can't please everyone .
In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech .
Don't try to take away all the offensive materials , it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was .
If you 're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is .
So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it .
It will still be around .
It is just something in our world that we have to live with
