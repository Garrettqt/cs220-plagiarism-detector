Book Censorship ?
Should books be censored ?
This a national problem about the contents of books .
It is a big deal .
What one parent feels is very offensive another @MONTH1 feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn .
If you ask me thaqt question I would say , ' @CAPS1 I believe the books should , but to a national scale and not a community one .
'
@CAPS2 this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of volgur nature , not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropiate for their child .
I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry .
Also i believe that it is the parents ' job to regulate what their children read .
If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropiate but the system don't then you need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf .
It is the parents ' job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf .
Like in Katherine Paterson's @CAPS3 ' All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf .
But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS2 this I believe she means that if we all took a book of the shelves for our children there would be no books because what is not offensive to you @MONTH1 be very offensive to another parent .
So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids .
@CAPS1 I believe in a goverment censorship program but to an extent .
It is the parents ' job to regulate the readings of their children , but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf
