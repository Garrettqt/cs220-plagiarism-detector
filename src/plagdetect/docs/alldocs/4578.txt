Controversy in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 someone walks in to there public @CAPS1 they are overwelmed with books .
Even though one person could never read that many books , the @CAPS1 has to have a wide selection , for the people that read different thing .
The @CAPS1 should not get rid of books that offened some people .
the @CAPS1 is a public place that allows people to read what they want .
If someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there .
Since the @CAPS1 is a public place , and people can not just throw away a book because that is offensive .
Just like Katherine Paterson said , 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
If everyone would throw away books that were offensive , there would be no books left .
This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning .
The public @CAPS1 is open for anybody to read a book .
Keeping this in mind the @CAPS1 has to have books that appeal to everyone .
If they would only have one type of book , not many people would want go the the @CAPS1 .
the @CAPS1 has to offened some people to please others .
People who go the @CAPS1 go because it is there choise to go and get a book .
If people find the books in the @CAPS1 offensive , they do not have to go .
Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them .
If someone finds a book offensive they dont have to read it .
Librarys should have as many books as they can , so they can appeal to every taste .
They should not get rid of books that offened a small group of people .
Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive .
Librarys are a public place for anybody to read what they want .
