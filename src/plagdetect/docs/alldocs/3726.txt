Censorship helps prevent people from viewing , listening , or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups .
But in the case of libraries , all the books would have to be taken off the shelves .
And if all the books are taken off the shelves , then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well .
Books are essential part of life .
They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art .
People who think that the books in libraries should be censored , are fools .
These people want to keep their children and themselves safe , and that is understandable , but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth .
Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored .
People who enjoy reading the books , that are wanted censored , would no longer be able to read those books .
It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves .
They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them , because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored .
And if that happens , then there would be no more books on the shelves .
The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1 .
Over all , books are a good thing .
They gives us inspiration , and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them .
It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you , not what other people think about them .
