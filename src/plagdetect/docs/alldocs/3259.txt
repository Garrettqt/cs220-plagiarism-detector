I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves .
If someone doesnt like a book , then they dont have to read it .
Books are ment to entertain or inform people .
There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner , but they still need to be out there so that people will know .
Libraries are out to make money thats all .
Let them make money , they can sell whatever they want .
If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could .
people will : watch , listen , read anything .
So why not sell it or rent it out .
It's a honest way of making money .
