I do belive in censorship , but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal .
It should the parants job to block materials that they think is bad for their kids .
If it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it .
My point of view in stoping materials like books , music , movies , and magazines is that some things are not ment to be shown , read , and heard by someone of a yonger age unless they get the ok from their parents .
The views of censorship in my mind is that if someone see something they don't like they want to get rid of it and if is something to wrong then yes it should be censor , but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it .
If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it , and if is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it .
I have never found a book and readed it and found it affensive or disterbing .
I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want any one to read it .
If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong , but for something that is bad about anetirer race or to graphic for a yonge age .
My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it we see it all the time in the real world people do something because they dont like some one they try some extreame things to get rid of some bad marerial , but in any case is a lot in this world that people should know about and when i do have kids I will decide wether to block something if I wont to and that is how it should be
