Libraries , not many people like them , but most people do .
Libraries are almost in every town .
People like to go there to read book , get on the computers , and do activities with their families .
But there are some things that people would really want to do things there but they can not because of their age or so , or it just might be prohibited at all times .
Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone ?
Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are a irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it could be the same ammount of money on buying that item .
If you are a responsible person then you are fine .
But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out .
So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there , because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you can not have that .
Libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books .
A section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers .
A section for the high schoolers and the adults and mostly everything will work out fine .
Just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town .
Now that some facts and opinions have been stated hopefullly the libraries and librariens do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone .
So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone
