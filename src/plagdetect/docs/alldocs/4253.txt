the author ketherine paterson is like letting you know like life is going to dont be behain go forword and grab the book from the shelf fot you and for your children because most of the book are gone because other people got them .
i would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids .
mom can grad some good books for the kids like a book that have the parts of the body grammer so they can start learning something rite no that they are lilttle and they will ganna star to make sentences.in @DATE1 in warsaw school the principal decide to remove everything from the library because people didnt go and check out books , music , movies , megazines , etc he decide to remove them because people didnt check out nathing and most of the people put everything in obserbation but my question is why people didnt check out something for their kids so they can start to read to learn something from their moms school .
in my opinion if i would the principal of the school i wouldnt take of the books nathing about the library i would live everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to lear how to read they ganna learn something special from their mom .
