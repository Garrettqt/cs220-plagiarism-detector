I disagree that certain material , books , movies , or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries .
There are three reasons why I argue this topic .
One reason is that books , music , etc .
that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book .
A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate , they should have identification to show that they are of age .
The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books , movies , music , etc .
for them for many reasons .
Ther should be nothing inappropiate in a library that a child can get a hold of .
A child should only have things appropiate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things they child hear , see , or read .
There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book , and let the child check the book or magazine out .
This is where th problem begin .
All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book , magazine , or music .
that why movies are rated , so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching .
A parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see .
I think that things inappropiate should stay on shelves , but I also think it shoud stay in the adult section of the library .
Childeren should not be able to go in the section for the adults .
The inappropiate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases .
There are some material that a adult @MONTH1 need to help in life .
In conclusion , childeren should not be able to get a hold of inappropiate material in a library , all libraries should identify someone the inappropiate material , and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries
