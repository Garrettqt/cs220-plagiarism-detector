If you take offense to certian things , you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that .
Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it .
Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first .
Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean .
Which is why they take offense to it , but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended .
You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future .
You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time , and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it .
Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended , just look from both points of view .
They both could have good ideas and functions to them .
Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them , don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them .
Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them .
If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad .
Sometimes they can even make you stess a little .
If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it .
Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them .
This works for a lot of situations not just this one , so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them .
