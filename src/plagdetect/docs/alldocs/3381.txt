I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it .
If everyone took the books , music , and movies off the shelves that they didn't like , then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves .
I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves .
Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out , or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it .
I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example , adult , young adult , children , and referance .
I 've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray , which brings me to another point .
Everyone has a opinion , if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else .
For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because , little kids might pick it up .
Well that is your opinion because , if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out .
Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason .
Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves , this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but , this book is there to inform people about slavery .
What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others .
In conclusion , I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you .
Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it .
That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves
