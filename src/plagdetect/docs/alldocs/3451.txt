The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book , movie , or magazine of their desire .
Not everyone is interested in the same book genre .
The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of .
If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them , they should not make a big deal about it .
They should not be removed from the shelves of the library .
I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library .
What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing ?
If the library took that movie off of the shelves , they would lose business due to one person .
If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian , it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie .
It just is not fair to everyone else .
The library is public property .
With that being said , it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment .
They are obligated to suppy books , movies , etc .
for whomever .
If one person does not like a particular book or magazine , they should search somewhere else for what they want .
A few years back , my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library .
There were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves .
That year , the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them , someone else was not pleased .
If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library , everyone would be happy .
If someone does not approve of a movie or something , they can search another shelf .
Those who complain are only making more work for themselves .
