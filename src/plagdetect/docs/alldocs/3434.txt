Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 'm writing your newspaper company this letter because @CAPS2 the same way Katherine Paterson feels , and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2 , and any sexual books .
Because they can scar a kids mind forever , so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library .
Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example , lets say a little boy asks were the action books are , the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too .
And in my opinion that is all I need to say .
Sincerly your customer @PERSON2 .
