Who cares about unsensored things anyway ?
Offensive things have been around in libraries , probably since the first library opened .
There has been 'offensive ' things in a library for as long as i can remember .
Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve ?
What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it ?
Ok , so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored , but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him .
If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading , why would it of been published ?
Publishers do read the books they publish them , they will not publish any random thing .
I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone .
If you cant be mature enough to take a article , book , or magizine seriously , then you dont need to be reading it anyway .
In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school .
That isnt because of unsensored things , why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at ?
Parents look at anyone and everyone , but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing .
It is never the parents fault .
If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion .
I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right .
Thank you for your time
