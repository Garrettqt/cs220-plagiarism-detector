I do belive that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see .
They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in .
They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy .
I know i dont .
Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that .
It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home .
Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex , and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read .
Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time .
So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wan na watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it .
