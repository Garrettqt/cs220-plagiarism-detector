I believe that books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should not be removed from the library shelves .
If the materials propose things like racism , I would like those items taken off the shelves .
Sometimes politics have a say in this .
This is my say on this topic .
First off , people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet .
All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive .
Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff .
The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are .
Also if the parents want to get books , why not go to a different library and get books .
Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored .
I only have one execption though , if the materials in the book , music , movie , magazine is racist in anyway , I would want that removed from the shelf .
Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials .
Sometimes the local , state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet .
Who knows , maybe someone likes these kinds of books , music , magazines , movies etc.
, and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet .
Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web ' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy , but thats their choice .
So thats my view on the censorship in libraries .
