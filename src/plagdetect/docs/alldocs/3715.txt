Censorship In everyday life we see stuff that we think is appropriate and should be romoved but do we have the right to be able to get that certain item off the shelfs to stop the sppread of this certain item , and is it safe for the future of kids not to see this kind of material in stores , librarys and book stores .
Most cartoons have violence in them , matter of a fact almost all them do , every conflict is resulted to violence over a certain thing , kids sit down to watch these and not understand that there is violence in them , and understand that it is wrong not to be violent like they see on tv , some shows , movies are not right for kids .
Same with books , now days kids get into newer books based off of movies , like twilight , these book series have violence in them and if parents had to censor what their kids could or could not read , most of these books would be off the shelf and won't be able to be viewed by anyone mostly kids .
In newspapers there are violence shown , reported , or even been told , as a fact of kids safty if they saw it they would want to go and see if it still going on and to see it , kid safty is a high priority because we care about the future of them , on what they read , view , or even hear from books , tv , movies , and in newspapers .
All these reasons are good enough to give parents some censorship on what their kids read , hear , and view on a daily bases , even if cartoons show violence , kids can watch them and enjoy them , but not act the violence shown in the cartoons and be saying some of the bad stuff it says in them .
