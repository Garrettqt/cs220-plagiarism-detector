How many of you have ever heard any offensive language ?
Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see ?
Im going to guess a lot .
Almost every person in the world has heard , said , or seen something that they shouldn't have .
Most hear curse words before they can even walk .
If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries .
After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace .
Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong , but they learn from it .
It allows them to mature and grow up .
Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said .
Yet , most will and see what happends and learn from it .
If you take out things like that in the books they read , then how will they learn ?
The books that children read varys .
The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older .
The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story , or a tragic monment in the characters life .
Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it .
Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write .
If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time .
Try and change what the reader might think about that time .
Leave the libraries ' books on the shelves no matter what is in them .
Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try .
Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history .
Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in
