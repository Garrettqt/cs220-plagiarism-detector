Books , music , movies , magazines , ect .
should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line .
If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs , you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone .
I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone .
I 've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff .
I went to the libarian , told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves .
We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves .
Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway .
Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves .
