I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries , except for things such as complete smut and pornography .
However there are many different beliefs on this subject .
Some parents @MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in , while others are more forgiving .
The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are .
A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child , he/she will be corrupted for life , but that is completely false .
Nowadays , almost every single person goes through something traumatic , witnesses something illegal , gets involved in drama , experiments sexually , and/or experiments with drugs .
The truth is , it's everywhere , and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it .
Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there , or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child , because chances are , he/she is already doing it all in real life .
It @MONTH1 even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it .
Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises .
I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography , and sex novels , racist books , ect .
Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers , and quit treating them like toddlers , they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad ' things out there .
Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world .
If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it , they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive ' books
