To whom it @MONTH1 concern : As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours , it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship .
Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive ' to be comprimised .
People these days though .
must be getting offended much more easily these days , because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been .
I for one , am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes ' as it were .
Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established , censorship shouldn't be up to a organization , but instead to the person viewing it .
In other words , why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch ?
Nobody knows you better than yourself , so why shouldn't you decide ?
Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives ?
There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing , it's all in how you take it .
No matter who it is , people are going to see things they don't want to see , that's just life .
Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech .
If you don't like something you 're seeing , then look away yourself
