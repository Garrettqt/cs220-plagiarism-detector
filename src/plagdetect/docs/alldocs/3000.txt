Hello , my name is @CAPS1 , I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries .
If they call it a 'media center , ' then why censor any media .
People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it , so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf .
People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1 , that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said . '
I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups , but to censor literature is just un- @CAPS5 .
There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger , because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for .
There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys , and those are as follows : pornography , non-educational movies , @CAPS6 @CAPS7 , and social networks .
I 'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but , shouldn't some leeway on books .
This is an approved message thank you for your time , goodbye .
