Should books , music , etc ; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive ?
well people have the right to look at what they want , to hear what they want .
Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright .
I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings .
Lets say i was in the library and i did see something offensive .
well the world does not stop and say `` hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her '' .
Am sorry but thats not how life works .
If you dont like looking at it then turn the other way .
If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves .
Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon .
There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at , to maybe hear thats offensive .
Heres what i say to it , get over it .
The other day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that i dare not to even say and i hate hearing that word .
What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that ?
......
I just rolled my eyes and went on about my buisness .
Should books , music , ect ; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive ?
well like ive been saying this whole time , in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you .
You have to get over it .
Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not easy
