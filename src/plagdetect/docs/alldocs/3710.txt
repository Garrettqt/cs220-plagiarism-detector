Does The Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ?
@CAPS2's alot of books out @CAPS2 that I would love to take off the shelve's but the one book I would to take off the shelve's would be 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 ' .
While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to .
On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all .
The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it .
Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again .
It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions .
But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's .
I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though .
Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards .
So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 ' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year .
So In @CAPS7 , I think @CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries .
