Should materials , such as books , music , movies , or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive ?
I don't think so , because it might not be offensive to every body , it would be brakeing the law , and it's not fair to the artist that created them .
Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone .
For example , some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive , while to others , it's there religion .
It would just go to show that one mans garbage , is another mans tresher .
It would also be braking the law , because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech .
It would silense all the great artist out there , trying to be herd .
They should be able to write , sing , or film what ever they want .
It is their right to do so .
That is the resion why they souldn't be removed from the shelves .
It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them , it would be braking the law , and what one person thinks isn't what every one thinks
