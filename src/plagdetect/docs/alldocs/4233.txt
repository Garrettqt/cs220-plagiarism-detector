All terms of offense are based on an opinion .
If one person finds a particular word offensive , doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way .
Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others , and some just dont care .
Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to .
The horror movies that are rater `` @CAPS1 ' for a reason , they could have nightmare for weeks .
Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten .
They still cant tell whats real and whats not .
They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel , to act , to do , even to think .
Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world .
No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society , it should just be given to you at your own disgression .
Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material .
All information is helpful , just not all is necessary .
These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children , even some teenagers .
This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday .
Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful ' movies , books , amgazines , @CAPS2 shows , and music .
It wont even phase anyone anymore .
