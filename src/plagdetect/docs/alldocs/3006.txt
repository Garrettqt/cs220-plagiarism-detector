A book is more than words or happenings ; they 're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another .
I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book , then someone from another country could read it .
Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books , music , and movies ; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today .
There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion .
They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy ; which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people .
I don't think they should take them off the shelves , but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect .
Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them .
While some of it is not appropriate , other parts of it guide us .
It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst , but are hoping for the best .
We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment , and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake .
I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams .
If we see that one person can do it , we think , why can't I ?
Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted ?
Entertainment pushes that concept , but adds everything in it to show the reality of it .
Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them , they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life .
