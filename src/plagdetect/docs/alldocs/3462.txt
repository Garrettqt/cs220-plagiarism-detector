How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read ?
I mean I find them everyday for example , how people use there language like swearing or even the tv show they watch .
I also hear when im with my friends or in a crowd of people .
You hear them everyday even if you don't want to , but you do .
I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period .
Its a public places and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the librarey .
What would happen if a child got ahold of one and they were looking it and if gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes , rap , or miss happens with something wrong .
Sometimes what children read , they will say it or they will do it .
so if a child see it they @MONTH1 think its alright to do it or they might think its amazing or cool to do and they might do it .
Also again , you hear it on a daily basic like swearing .
Lets say your child hears or reads horable language and they might say it to you or some of your friends , and you wont know where they heared or who told them .
The movies even have something to do with it to , because it all the movies are together kids to adults movies .
they should separet the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug related , something that you dont want your children to or even hear to .
Even though you hear them daily , you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around .
They need to take those book that discribe anything about crime , drugs , or even movies .
Thats why i think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shevles and get them away from children
