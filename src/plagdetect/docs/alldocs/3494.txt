NO , I think books and ect .
should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive !
It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech .
No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin .
As long as it's apporiate for the enviroment and its surronds , there should'nt be any problems .
If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left .
Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views .
It's most likely that someones goin to get offened .
In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened .
Some offensive things are part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now .
What's a child without it's @CAPS1 ?
Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , but their not complaining about the books and etc .
then no one should .
You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery.Books about how only a couple of us made it .
Magazines about how we sex and kill each other .
Papper telling how are black communties are failing .
So in my opioin , no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve .
It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on .
It's apart of @CAPS1 and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself .
People always saying kids should read more .
What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive ?
