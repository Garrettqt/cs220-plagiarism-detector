The library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public .
Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place .
First , there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library .
What if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone .
That person then could end up using the information for the worst .
Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages .
Next , there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library .
So things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt .
The librarian or any one whos in there @MONTH1 never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @MONTH1 happen or a problem is started .
Therefore blocks should be put up for things that maybe be harmfull to others .
Finally , although people @MONTH1 feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out , they should think , it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at .
Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one .
People have to think the library is open to children and elderly .
In conclusion , there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library .
There is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed .
Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up , checks out or even says .
