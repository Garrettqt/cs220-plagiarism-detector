Do I believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , and so on should be removed ?
Yes I think that they should all be removed , becuase it could hurt people's feelings , and could make them do plenty of things .
Such as suicide , drama , and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings .
I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else ?
I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better .
From exsperince in the library last week , I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american , and the book said something about thier race .
And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again .
I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life , call me names , and beat me , that kind of thing would just ruien my day .
Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock .
Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience .
I think that they should take my advice , and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids , teenagers , or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff .
All it does is bring some people down , make them cry , and also so stupid stuff .
Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart , and make things better for everyone
