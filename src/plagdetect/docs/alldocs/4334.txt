Do I think that books , movies , music or magazines should be removed from the library ?
No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's .
I 'm going to be honest here , most people like to read .
I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study .
How would I study ?
Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books , or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids .
Parents do the samething .
People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time .
I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework , regular work , or even being stressed out .
There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people .
If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints .
Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before .
People do it for there kids or grand kids , I don't really see the big deal .
Its not like they are watching anything bad .
They mostly have kid movies not bad ones .
Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids ?
In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody .
