Hello I am kristin , I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries .
Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine .
But I have and I also use to read them .
In some of thouse issues are sex tips .
Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no .
They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen .
A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section .
Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex .
But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also .
There are also some other things that need out of a librarie .
Some music might not be the best choice for a young child .
Like for example rap music .
It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex .
Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain .
Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it .
Thats not what I want my kid to listen to .
I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse .
Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1 .
But if it is they can't watch it .
I 'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so .
She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her .
She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded .
This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries
