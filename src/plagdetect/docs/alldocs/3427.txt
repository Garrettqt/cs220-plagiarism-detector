Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves ?
No we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves .
Think of it in your own perspective .
For example , say you like horror books .
If someone else doesn't like horror and you do , and they take it off of the shelves , how mad would you be .
I like @CAPS1 magazines .
Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 , or @ORGANIZATION1 .
If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off .
My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book , magazine or whatever it might be up .
Don't just sit there and complain , because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you ?
I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems .
At my school , we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 .
Just non-hurtful things .
All it took though was one person to complain about it , and boom !
They were gone .
@CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone .
So really , what is the problem ?
The problem is that people can't handle what they see .
It is understandable to a certain point .
Like if your a very religous person , then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things .
But when you do it just to spite someone , then that is very hurtful .
Finally , i just want to say that if you have a problem , keep it to yourself .
Just because you don't like something , doesnt mean someone else won't .
You wouldnt want it to happen to you
