Book Censorship Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1 .
The question is , 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out ? '
Or another question is , ' @CAPS1 did they let my child check that out ? '
@CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions , and should have attention put toward them .
In my oponion , books should have a age limit on them .
My reasoning is becuase , kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group .
There are plently of books out there for all age groups .
A kid under @NUM1 , should not be able to check out a book , magazine , movie , or music that has offensive language , racial slurs , or dirty behivor from the character , or artist .
Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out , is becuase kids can get the wrong idea .
Lets say , a book has a statment in it that says ' @CAPS3 , I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol . '
@CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read .
It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could ' be doing .
The age limits for book shelves should be as followed : @CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1- @CAPS6 @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading .
Plus , it would help the kid in deciding on what to read .
I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups , will stop the commotion .
Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1 .
With everything I have listed , I am pretty sure that the questions , 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out ? '
and ' @CAPS1 did they let my child check that out ? '
with be answered .
Age groups on books , is a great idea .
