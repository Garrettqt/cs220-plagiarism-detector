I am a citizen of the @LOCATION1 and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better .
It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect .
in the library .
Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level .
I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now .
On the other hand , those books @MONTH1 be needed .
Some people need those types of books and magezines for research papers and things like that .
Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong .
Its also up to the parent or gaurdian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library .
But then some children dont have a mature parent or gardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books .
Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books , movies , music , magazines , ect .
in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better .
There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things .
But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books .
Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audiance only .
