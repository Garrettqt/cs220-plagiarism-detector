I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive .
The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic .
For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2 .
In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4 .
Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said .
Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it .
People might have their own point of view , no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like .
If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places , I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material .
They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read , listen , or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious .
I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious ?
They might be offended of what one person says but who cares , not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said .
Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves and in your believes .
Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves
