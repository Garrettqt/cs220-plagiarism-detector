The seven books which constitute the ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country .
The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light , they must be harming our innocent children .
Many books , from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 ' to the ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account .
Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive .
Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7 , every citizen has the freedom of speech , press and religion .
By censoring the speech of authors , their rights have been denied .
It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said , and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right .
By prohibiting books such as ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 ' to be read ; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded .
Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft ( and therefore satanism ) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 ( the @CAPS15 in the series ) is homosexual .
However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil .
Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1 .
However , even if every school in the country took ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' off the shelves ; that would not , and should not , stop children from reading these books .
Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 ' began to be part of many schools ' curriculum in the @DATE1 , it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute .
That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel , which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults .
Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect ' .
If a parent , however , does not want his or her child to read such a novel ; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads .
But just because one parent does not want their child to read ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ' , does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it .
Censorship should be a matter of the private , not public sphere .
Books and other works should not be censored in libraries .
In doing so ; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded .
And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works ; the children will still find a way to access them
