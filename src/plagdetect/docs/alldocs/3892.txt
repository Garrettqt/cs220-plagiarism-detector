Here in @LOCATION1 , it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech .
Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions .
This should also include books , music , movies , magazines , and any other form of entertainment .
However , there will always be people that could take offense to others ' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech .
In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library , then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given .
He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable .
It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech .
What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like .
So , why should other peoples ' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon ?
It shouldn't .
Everyone expresses themselves in their own way .
It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way .
Whether it's writing books , posting articles , or writing music , it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style .
It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style .
Censorship should not be allowed in libraries .
If there was a type of censorship , it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy .
It would also be taking away the artists ' or authors ' freedom of speech and expression .
There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country .
Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right .
Sure , they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff .
but why keep them from the real world ?
Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art .
