This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some .
I do not believe things should be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone .
Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all .
If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them .
One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet .
When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me .
If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back .
I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs .
The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups .
The sections are split into children , teens , and adults .
I ' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive .
If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know .
Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .
I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't n't
