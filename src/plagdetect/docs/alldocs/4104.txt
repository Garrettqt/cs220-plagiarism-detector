There are thousands of books in libraries now a days , some are from @NUM1 years ago .
Books are books , and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf .
Books , music , movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading .
Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved .
There are many people in the world , who like all different types of books .
But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story .
I enjoy reading stories about romance , and I 'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story .
I only prefer romance stories , and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves , I wouldn't read any type of book .
Because I only enjoy reading about the romance .
I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories , and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship .
It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories .
There many be people who find it so interesting , that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation .
Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life .
Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in .
I 'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries
