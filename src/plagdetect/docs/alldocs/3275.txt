Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper , or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern .
It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today .
Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace .
Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor .
Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book .
Once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section .
I couldnt help but laugh , because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library .
When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at , she turned the cover over with no reservation and , said ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' .
'
I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' , I thought silently to myself .
Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information .
I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree .
I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant .
But when we let our children , the future of the world , vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected , @CAPS9 teens and violent video games , or explicit magazines .
For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library , books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled ' @CAPS12 @CAPS13 ' , which means my struggle in german .
My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children .
Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored , this includes public libraries , retail stores , the internet , and @CAPS14 .
I believe books should be censored by content much like movies .
This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect
