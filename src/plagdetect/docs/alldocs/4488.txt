I think that movies , and magazines should be censured to kids at the library .
There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured .
I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get .
The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them .
I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing .
I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is .
The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines .
I know three in perticular off the top of my head , and they are @CAPS2 , @CAPS3 , and @ORGANIZATION1 .
These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed .
I really don't any kid , teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed .
They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try .
This could cause them to get very sick and if they 're already skinny , they could possibly die .
Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured .
I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes .
I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance , because they are pretty boring .
Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content
