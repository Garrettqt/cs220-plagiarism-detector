The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored .
I believe that libraries shouldnt have to take out books with offensive language .
If the author likes how it was originally made , then thats how they would like to present it .
It would be taking away a Right in the @CAPS1 .
If you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word .
That isnt up to the public to make a decision .
Its almost like rewriting history .
It would be like having someone take out a word in the @ORGANIZATION1 .
If any word is changed it is a incorrect @ORGANIZATION1 .
It just changes the entire subject .
You can not reword whats been written .
Public views are starting to take over the world .
Instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive .
Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery .
Slavery is a strong , bold word that represents a horrible thing .
If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again .
I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or dont read it
