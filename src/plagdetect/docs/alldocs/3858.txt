The @CAPS1 Materials Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good , but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know .
My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves .
People should have ther own choice of books , and who has the right to tell someone what they should read .
My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf , but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books , music , movies , etc ..
I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age .
The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1 , but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes , just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie .
This was experience that I been through , which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed .
Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things .
No one is going to have the same interest all the time .
So by takiny materials away is just helping one person , but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in .
I can understand that people have been through things , and might not be happy that offensive materials are around .
Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy , and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from .
In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay .
The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual , might just be very interesting to another person .
This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine , 'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure ' which I believe is a good saying for this topic
