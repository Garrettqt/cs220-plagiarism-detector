The book called @CAPS1 .
the book is about a young @CAPS2- @CAPS3 man that starts school at @ORGANIZATION1 .
While the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of .
So one day he has join a boxing class , and the wreslting team at his school .
But at the end of the book he ends up fighting everybody the was bullin him .
I personaly the book should be kept on the self because its a life changing expersance for a young man .
For some people this book they will or have even read this book several times , I know I have .
I only hope that othere people will like or even love this book as much as I have .
So I guess what I am trying to say is you really never know what you are going to like in till us sit there and read it from beganing to the end
