NEWSPAPER @CAPS1 today im going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries.Offensive materials such as books , magazines , music , movies are found in libraries to some people.But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place.Thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things .
The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away.Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that book that other people would say is offensive.And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting alot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books , movies , ect.So people wont have to look at those offensive materials.Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books , movies , ect.Because not every one likes the same thing.People have different intrests and outlooks on different things.So people should just except the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that.And dont always just think about yourself look at the big picture .
So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries.And I hope that you can see my point that im trying to get across .
