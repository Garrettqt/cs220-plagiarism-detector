Many @CAPS1 have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not .
It's depends on one's beliefs and morals .
I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries .
I think that @CAPS1 should have the freedom to choose what to read , watch , or listen to .
Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe .
It also depends on a person's age and maturity level .
Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't .
The situation is different for each person .
It's hard to judge certain materials because some @CAPS1 might find it acceptable while others might not .
There would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not , and these standards would clash with each other .
It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @CAPS1 .
If someone finds something offensive , then they don't have to check it out .
I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument .
For example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level .
That's what movie ratings are for .
Materials should be organized that @CAPS1 can easily see if they would be offensive or not .
For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate .
It should be obvious to @CAPS1 who would find it offensive and who wouldn't @CAPS1 should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves .
A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want .
Just because somebody finds a book offensive , that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it .
That being said , certain things can be done so that @CAPS1 would know if something would be offensive or not .
