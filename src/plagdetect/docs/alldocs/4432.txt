Do I think that certain books , music , movies , magazines should be removed from our librarys .
No i dont think they should be removed , they could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive .
If they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth .
Book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn .
Most of the time they leave out bits and pecies about what really happened .
So if they took the offensive books , music , movies , and magazines out , a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble .
From my own experience , I enjoyed reading , listening , and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our librarys .
So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them , that will solve your problem , and teach your children that to .
Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials .
If people still complain , move it to another part of the library , in seperate room or somethin of that kind .
This should solve the problem of kids reading , listening , and watching these kinds of things .
