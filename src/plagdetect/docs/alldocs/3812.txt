If I think that something is offensive then yes , it should be removed from the bookshelves .
The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people .
If something offended you then u wouldnt want someone else of the same race , religion , or family to read it and be offended .
Yes , we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want , but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped .
Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good .
If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black , then the blacks would notjust stand around and do nothing .
After u call someone names or pick one them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life .
Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others .
So if i seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes , i would want it to be removed so it doesnt offend anybody else .
I dont think that hurting someones feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself .
If something hurt u or offended u would u just let it happen or would u use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else ?
Would you want somneone writing about u in a mean way ?
You would probly try to make it right .
If you could fix something and didnt just because you didnt feel like it and it continued to offendother people then not only is it the persons fault that wrote it but i could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still burt people .
