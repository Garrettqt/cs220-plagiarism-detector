What do you consider an offensive book ?
Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive .
So how can you justify that a book , magizine , movie , music , etc .
should be removed from a shelf due to content .
Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive .
The items that do contain graphic content , cursing , etc .
and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others .
So honestly no one can say that a certain book ( s ) , music , movie ( s ) , magazine ( s ) , etc .
do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed .
If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else .
Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf .
Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item .
So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it , or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf ?
No you can't .
If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules
