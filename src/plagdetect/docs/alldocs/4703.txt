When picking a book , music , movie , and magazines from the library it's always a hard decision because you @MONTH1 be like me and want to read more than one book at a time .
Books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books .
So why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive ?
When children pick books from the library you want to make sure their kids books and you @MONTH1 also want to check to see if their educational .
You definitely wouldn't want a little kid getting ahold of an adult book or a book that is found offensive in some way .
So have an adult section and a kids section .
When we walk into a library full of books , theirs a huge variety of any kind of books .
We would lower the use of going to the library if books were takin off the shelves because their wouldn't be any use of going .
If your not going to find a book there , why go to the library anymore ?
The last reason to not take books off the shelfs is people that can not afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book .
So taking books away would just limit their learning and would not be very benificial to them .
The only reason that I would find it okay to take offensive books and anything else off shelves is for childrens sake and safety .
If the library's are thinking about taking offensive books off shelves , they should have a public vote to see what everyone else thinks about it .
If they decide to take books off the shelves , why not just have an adult section in the library ?
Anybody that is @NUM1 years of age or older could be in there .
So make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us
