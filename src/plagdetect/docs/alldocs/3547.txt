To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern , I belive that books , movies , and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive .
@CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different .
I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have a speacial place for them , to where mature people will be able to read them .
Books are very valuable to most people in the united states .
Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive .
But is @CAPS3 really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write .
Just because one person reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive .
I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way .
Along with movies , and etc .
I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library .
There are kids sections , @CAPS1 sections , And even a teenage section .
I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life .
But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them .
If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this would be the topic right here .
Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized .
So why could they not make a section just for books , movies , magazines that people find offinsive .
Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey , @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3 .
As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive from libraries .
I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys .
People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies , or magazines .
@CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen , @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide .
