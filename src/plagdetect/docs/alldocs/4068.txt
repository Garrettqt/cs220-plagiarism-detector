Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 , I 've recently finish reading a quote of the great author , Katherine Paterson , and her feelings towards the certain type of material use in books .
For example some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offended be certain type of language used in books .
Other @MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite approprite .
With that being said , I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with , you should just pick up another book instead .
My beliefe is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world .
Authors shouldn't be denied the oppertunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings .
@CAPS1 shouldn't be allow to give hateful opion just because they didn't like a book .
As I see it no one is forcing them to read it .
Now I 'm not saying I 'm a huge reading .
As a matter of fact I barely read but when i do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading .
The way authors discribe things even with sometimes profanity is just amazing .
You can actually feel that you 're part of the book .
Now then my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 be horrible but to others it @MONTH1 be the best book in the world .
So if you do start taking down books from the shelfs you would ended up with nothing but a huge , empty shelf .
There's no book out there that is what we would consider , ' The perfect book . '
@CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments .
This world is to big to start picking and choosing .
My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling .
So tell me , what's your belief then ?
