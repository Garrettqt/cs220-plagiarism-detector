There are so many resaons why taking a book , movie , or anything else off the shelves is wrong .
If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie , then don't read it or watch it find something else .
If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive .
Every book can't be perfect for that person .
Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it .
If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it .
There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it ' .
They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad .
Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore .
That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive .
People know what they like and don't like , so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it .
It all comes down to common sence .
We all have it we just need to start using it .
That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it .
Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads .
If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine .
