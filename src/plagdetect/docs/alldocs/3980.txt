People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it .
Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older .
Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it .
I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them .
Yea some parents dont care what their child reads .
Think about the ones that do .
Not every one has the guts to say something to the school .
If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school .
Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not .
Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions .
Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it .
I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books .
This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc .
with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools .
If you agree YOU can do something about it .
Talk to your childs school
