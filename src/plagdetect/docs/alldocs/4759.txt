Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive .
Movies , books , songs and magizines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive .
I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose .
If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also .
When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs .
Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience .
When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is ; it's to get a point across .
If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it .
If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about .
Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them .
If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away .
Other people might injoy reading that book .
If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away .
I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public shouyld be removed .
Not everyone finds certain things offinsive in the media .
Again , everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose ; it's purpose is to get a point across to others .
