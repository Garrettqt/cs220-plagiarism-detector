There are many kinds of books , music , movies , and magazines in one library .
People all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects .
Some people take offence to certain books , songs , movies , magazines , etc .
Another person @MONTH1 not and think its offencive at all .
For example , a religous book that talks about @CAPS1 being one guy when some people beleive differently .
The book should not be put away , for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs .
The variety of subjects in a library such as songs , magazines and everything else in the library is huge .
There should never be a book , movie , or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in Katherine Paterson quote , its makin the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could .
Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem .
People would not be able to read as much as they 'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options .
The library provides information for teachers , students , researchers , writers and for readers who do it as a hobby .
If that was takin away from people , the people would become less informed about many things in the world .
In @CAPS2 freedom is important and we expect it , freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests .
Therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that , @CAPS2 would not let this happen .
People have the right to like whatever they want , if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should walk away from it and not stress about removing it
