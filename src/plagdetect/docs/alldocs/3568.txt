I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book , magazine , or movie offensive .
I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended , they are obviously paranoid .
If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book , then don't allow them to get it .
Don't make all of the other people suffer .
Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem .
You know what they say , 'If it ain't broken , don't fix it . '
@CAPS1 of all , people have a variety of opinions .
Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok .
If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive , what will the next person think ?
They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book .
Then it would create a big conflict .
Lastly , parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature .
They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong .
If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they 're young , what will they do when they discover it when they 're older ?
As a child , it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong .
Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults .
Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society .
In other words , censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society .
The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong .
It's one of the ideals that help make this country great
