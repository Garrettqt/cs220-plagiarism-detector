If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes , they can feel offensive about the @CAPS7 things inside the magazine or books .
These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these @CAPS1 things , those people are called ' @CAPS2 ' .
They can find A eazy way to get something started just like that , That's why before i buy A magazine , I take A look inside of first And see If @CAPS3 interested in buying that specific certain book , or magazine .
If I don't like the things that I see inside of @CAPS5 , then I @CAPS4 not buy @CAPS5 , @CAPS5's @CAPS1 As that .
If they are @CAPS7 , they should immediately be removed from the news stands on the streets of @LOCATION1 , @LOCATION6 , @LOCATION12 , @LOCATION4 , @LOCATION2 , @LOCATION5 , @LOCATION8 , @LOCATION9 , @LOCATION3 , @LOCATION10 , @ORGANIZATION1 , @ORGANIZATION2 , Or @CAPS8 @LOCATION11 , @LOCATION7 .
