Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves ?
Should movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant ?
Magazines are offensive , they always have been , they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said .
There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people , replay a bad part of somebodys life , say things about people.Music is just words and sound , they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past , that people would find offensive .
I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail , but do i think that should be taken off the computer , no its entertaining.This world needs something to keep us intertained .
Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters , no paparazzi .
We wouldnt know anything going on around the world , and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive , i can understand where they are coming from , getting talked about all the time , especialy about mistakes you have made in your lives , but thats how the world functions , thats always going to be apart of everyones lives , talk .
So as i have been saying , getting rid of movies , music , magazines , books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion , cause what would entertain us if they were gone ?
