I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored .
It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people .
Mocking a dissability like there have been movies made doing .
Well actually , there is a movie I 've seen before called The @CAPS1 and its a guy that made fun of a special olympic team , then lied about having a dissability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine.That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a dissability .
I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldnt be brought out
