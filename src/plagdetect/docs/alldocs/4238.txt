I have read a few books that I dont approve of .
And I feel that yes i do have a right to remove these books from the shelves .
But whose to say what i think should have an affect .
Honestly i do not think that books should be taking off the shelves or music should be banned ect ...
I think that there should be a little more athority on the age limit of books in libraries , and a seperate place for music and other things of that nature .
I would not want my kid to walk out of the library with a book about sex , gangs , or stuff that should not be known by a kid .
Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books off shelves why not put a strict age limit on books , and actually stand by it .
Yes there is an adult section a kids section ect .. , but i 've seen so many young kids walking out with books magazines and other adult items .
I know how it feels to try and concentrate on a book newspaper or magazine you are interested in when people are blareing there head phones .
And i still feel the same way about the music as i do with books .
Dont bann it from the library just bann it from certain areas of the library .
Its all out of respect to people who are wanting to be in a quiet area .
Im not the type of person who wants to take things away from people because everyone has there own interests and beliefs in life , but i am one who believes in setting rules that should be followed .
I see good comming out of everything a library has to offer if only they could exclude things in certain areas .
And also set and stand by the age limits of the books being checked out .
