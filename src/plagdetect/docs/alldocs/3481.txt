Many books in libraries have profanity , it just depends on how you read and anazlyze the profanity .
To some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head .
To others the words are just offensive .
I disagree that most books are offensive to readers I believe that they just help the writers get their points across .
Many children come across books with offensive language , but if they only read books that are within their age level then they shouldn't have these problems .
In adult books there is more offensive language , but to adults eyes and ears its a different story because they hear , and possibly say a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow .
I believe that any offensive reading material should be found and then sent to a certain area of the library where if you are an adult then you can check these books out .
This is a way to keep the children away from these books , words , and to keep them 'innocent ' still .
Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow , but of course this is up to their guardian .
It's not necassarily a bad thing to have strong language in books , as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending , which is most likely to help the theme .
Children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves .
They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only
