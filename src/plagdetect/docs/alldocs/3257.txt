No because the writer is explain th way the story really happend.If ur kid ask u the word tell him/her it not a good word to say , r u can take the book back and get him/her a new one .
Say him/her kids comes home from school and say a couse word and u asked him/her were they learned it from .
An they said the teacher said it .
U can tell the teacher u dont wounting ur him/her reading that book .
Cousing is a way of explain the story better to them i guess .
