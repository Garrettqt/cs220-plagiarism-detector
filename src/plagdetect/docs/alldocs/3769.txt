My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf .
I think you should have to have permission from a parent , or guardian if the material is explicit .
For example in a store where you buy cd's , games ect ... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books .
Say a book has a certain word on it like ' @CAPS1 ' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name .
That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover .
Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter .
Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about .
Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge , and explain top them what the problem is in your case .
Also you could always have a section of the store , or librarie just for adults only .
It @MONTH1 sound stupid , but it can actualy help out alot .
There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children .
Such as love books , they talk about love , and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children .
If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children , or other childrens minds .
You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see .
Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see
