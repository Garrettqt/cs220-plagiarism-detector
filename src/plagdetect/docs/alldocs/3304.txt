How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as , ' @CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2 ' ?
Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries ?
I would , I think anything that was hurtful , harmful , or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn .
Books , magazines , and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have .
Sure it might hurt , depress , or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past .
For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us .
Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries .
Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available .
Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide , and without knowing about it how can it be prevented .
Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts .
Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide .
I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it .
In conclusion , I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public .
I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn .
I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime
