@CAPS1 are many prespectives on censorship in our country .
Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do .
But we have to live with it , @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old , young , parents , and children .
In libraries @CAPS1 are some books , music , etc that @MONTH1 be offensive to people .
But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil .
Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her .
I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in @CAPS1 otherwise they shouldn't be in @CAPS1 looking at whatever they are wanting to read about .
The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us .
But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge .
The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children .
Because parents don't want children to look @NUM1+ material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden .
I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it .
And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at .
