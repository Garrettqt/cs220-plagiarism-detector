If I was givin the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries , I would think neither taking the books off the shelf , nor leaving them on @CAPS1 are quite correct .
I would defiently reccomend a voting to take place , in order to figure out what to do with the books .
I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs , in which some could be offended .
So I would take at least ten different people with different religions , backgrounds , and so forth , and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books .
People believe differently , so it would be hard to please them all .
That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone .
Just like my mom said , 'you will never make everyone happy . '
@CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people , and what might majorly offend one , might have no effect on the other .
This is the main reason voting is rough , because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today .
You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before , because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before .
Although if the book is voted to stay in the library , I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area .
Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people , should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know , like a child , comes upon that book .
Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now .
Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election , but also can be used for this reason as well .
Voting is always important and people should notice that .
I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today
