No , the books and etc .
should not be moved , because anybody can be interested in them .
Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them .
First , there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc .
are coming in .
Everyone is into different materials , books and stuff .
That's why I say do not remove the items .
People might come in the library looking for a book that they want .
If that person can find it they might complain , or take there bussiness else where .
Then the library could start losing bussiness .
Second , if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing .
What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library .
The owner of the library can lose money if it close down , because everyone don't have computer's and books at home .
They can come do there research and rent books .
Third , some people go to the library for peace and quiet , and the library is there only place .
Little children go to the library looking for books and etc .
to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying .
If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed .
Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost .
Students school's might not have the book they are looking for , and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book .
In conclusion , these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc .
should be taken out of the library .
Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them .
