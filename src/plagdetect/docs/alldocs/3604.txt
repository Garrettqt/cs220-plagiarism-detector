I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it .
There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it .
That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book .
It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper .
Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them .
So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book
