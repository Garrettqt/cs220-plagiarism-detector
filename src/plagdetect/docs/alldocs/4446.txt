No I do not believe that certain materials should not be remove from the shelves because I dont see how they are offensive to other people .
Even if its war movies its telling what these men have gone through and they fought and lost there friends .
You just dont see people just killing and shooting you see the emoutions of the men and its emoution to you to see that .
Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person and a lot of books has lots of history that you can learn from .
The only thing that I think that should be remove is the music because if its rap or anything like that should not be allow in libraries , it brings hatered and often killing to the country and that should not be allowed .
Some Magazines should be allowed like raceing , sports , or military but all of the other bad stuff should stay out because if they do see , the kind of stuff that shouldnt be seen it will get into there mind .
Thats what I think about this whole idea
