@CAPS4 I think all books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary .
Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means .
Then , I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear .
The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group .
Next , I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too .
Things that doesnt control their language such as ( @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ) .
I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show , and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show .
Finally , magazines ...
I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not .
I think that etc .. should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things .
Inconclusion , All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch .
Because children pick up everything they hear and see
