If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf ?
I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people , that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music .
Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people .
Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike .
If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today .
This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out .
Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself .
People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it .
We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies .
No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through .
Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people .
Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but , music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out .
I 've never felt offended because of a song i 've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want .
Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either got ta het used to it or stay offended .
Books , music , movies , or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions .
I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things
