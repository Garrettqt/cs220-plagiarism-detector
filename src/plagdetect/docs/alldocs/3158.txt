I feel that they shouldnt be removed due to the fact that somebody else @MONTH1 like that movie , book , music , or magazine .
Just becuase we might not like it doesnt mean theirs somebodyout there that do .
Everything shuld be in the library becuase their are different people and not everybody like the same things .
The library suppose to have everything so if we declared to take something off the shelf becuase due to the fact one or a couple more people dont like something or whats being displayed out to people it wouldnt be right .
I have been to the library and looking for an movie or a book that i like or want to see and it have not been there i have got mad for that .
So ifeel as if it's not right nor fair .
Everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch .
Even though there are certain books or movies out their that chidren should not touch , i still feel as if they shouldnt remove anything off th shelves .
