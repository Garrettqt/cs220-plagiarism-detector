The librarys are made for everyone , from childern to adults .
There @MONTH1 be somethings that should not be in certian areas or even in the place at all .
With the librarys having all age groups of books there , their @MONTH1 or should not be some material in thoes areas for them to see .
let alone @MONTH1 not even be there to begin with .
Any age of childern can pick up a material that @MONTH1 contain eaither offensive/or just some things that they should not see .
I think that librarys should only contain materials that are approiate for all age groups .
This is my oppion why i think librarys should only have materials with approiate images and words for all age groups .
You dont know what your or someone eals child @MONTH1 pick up and read or hear .
The beat thing to do is have all approiater materials and nothing eals
