We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want , and do as long as it is within the laws .
If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong , then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization .
A great man once said ' @CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it . '
@CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes .
Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was .
'
@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6 ' is under critism because it uses the ' @CAPS7-word ' alot in the text .
There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked , back in the day , and how things were done .
If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh , harsh thing .
When I think of censorship in the library , I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened .
Censorshiop should be on tv , movies , and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl , but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying .
There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past , the present , and the future .
