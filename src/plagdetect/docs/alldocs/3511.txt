Many of us have been at the library once in our life time , but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with ?
Well many of us have .
Should the library have books , magazines , or even movies that are offensive to your kids , little borther/sisters , or friends ?
The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do , not to see a nacket picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids .
Well we can do something about that .
Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship .
The books , magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves .
A lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive .
They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influins .
In the library there should be good and fun books , magazines , and movies .
The people that work at the library should remove all the bad itams .
Allowing to have all the nacket pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it .
This is why the libraries should remove all this books , movies , magazines , and even music !
Many of the older people @MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them .
Well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff .
Some of the older people @MONTH1 think different and others they @MONTH1 think the same .
Many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books .
That's why removing these itams are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learing how to have a boy/girlfriend
