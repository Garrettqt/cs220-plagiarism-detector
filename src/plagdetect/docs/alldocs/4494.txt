Taking books off the shelves ?
I don't think so .
When you go to the library , what kind of books do you look for ?
I like mysteries and scary books , they keep me on the edge of my seat , however ; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me .
People are saying they want to remove books , music , and movies from the library when they are found offensive , but I think that is a bad idea .
People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice .
You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes .
From my own experience , I had to get a movie at the library once for a project .
It was about the civil war .
The movie had some disturbing scenes in it , but I had to watch it for school .
If it had not been at the library , what would I have done ?
That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea .
As I said at the beginning , I like mystery books .
Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive .
The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl .
I think this would be an offensive book for someone young , or for someone who's loved one was murdered , but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library .
If they took books like that away , what would the people that like them do ?
It does not seem fair to me .
For people who find books , movies , music , or magazines at the library offensive , simply do not use them .
The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in .
So lets keep everyone in mind , and their different interrests .
It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive .
It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library
