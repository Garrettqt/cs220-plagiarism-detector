yes because what if a @NUM1 year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way .
Now if a man walks in and finds a offensive book about his race he @MONTH1 take the shitchuration to a new level like maby he @MONTH1 demand it to be taking off the shelf or somthing else .
If a women walks in with her son or daughter and find a dirty nasty book about sex , drugs , guns and knifes .
So yes a offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public libeary .
Only reason the books should be taken off the shrelf is because if its a public libeary alot of kids and their pearents to read , do research and do homework .
And that is why a public libaery should take a offensive book off their shelf
