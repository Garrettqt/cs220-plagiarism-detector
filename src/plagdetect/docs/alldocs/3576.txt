Do I believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive ?
Well what do you think ?
I think they should depending on cause or what degeree of the party being offended .
I feel if there are books , movies , or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended .
If you have a racist book against all races like blacks , asian , or mexican etc ... other minorities @MONTH1 find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it , then yes take it off the shelves .
If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent .
Also , if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business .
So to avoid all of the fighting and lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites .
If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well .
Plus , they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they 're coming from poverty srticken towns , homes countries .
I myself , am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we 're all unique in our own ways that is what makes us who we are today .
