I believe that there are certain movies , music , and other things that are bothering parents .
I would not whant my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you wether if its write or wrong , I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are bieng tought bad things .
I believe that there are some movies that are to violent for anyone to see , but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch any way .
There are movies made for adults , but how many adults let their kids watch them to .
No matter what they make there will be people who dont like what they see or they know somebody who didnt like what they saw.Some times there are people that dont like what they hear , or knows somebody who didnt like what they hear 'd in music or on the television .
There are times my mom here's something on t.v or music and said turn that of .
my friends all listen to this music that i dont think amounts to nothing but the production of inmates , and other wrong doings such as , gangs , fights , shootings , and jurry trials .
there are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies .
Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw , and they are trying to do what they saw , becuase they think that it will make them look cool .
There will always be things that peolpe do not like and will never like .
I learned that when I was young , just like most young kids have .
I think the biggest thing that sell's , is the dramma , action movies , and the stuff that parents will like .
Very little of baby movies , and baby music .
But what can you do about that ?
I like most of what I hear , and see .
I have always thought there was a lot of violence , and picture shots , and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young.This is what I think .
