Have you ever read a book you thought was offense ?
Have you ever read a book you didn't want any one else to read ?
I agree with katherine paterson if we can take one book off the shelfs we can take all the books of the shelf .
Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor .
Which means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries .
This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy .
Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them .
The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids , but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf !
One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them .
As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read , such as romance or horror books , adult books , some action books .
Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them , but some poeple like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it .
does that seem fair ?
?
Now does some of those books seem a little better now ?
Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing , and romance , and serial killers , but for some people enjoy reading those novels .
This is why i agree with Katherine @PERSON1
