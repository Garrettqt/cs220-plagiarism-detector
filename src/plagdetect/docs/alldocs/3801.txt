There are some certain materials i think is affensive to childrens is book , music , movies an even magazines.Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to @CAPS1 books and other unsafe materials.Another thing is music , and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them.Movies such as @CAPS1 movies some children @MONTH1 watch them and reflect wat they have watched on tv.The next thing is magazines , has material such as appropreate pictures in them tats why they should take the books , music , movies and magazines off the shelf .
