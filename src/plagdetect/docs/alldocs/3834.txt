Bad @CAPS1 @CAPS2 off yes , I do think think they should be removed if they are bad .
If you wouldn't say it to your parents face when your at a younger age then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it .
I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldnt say to my face .
There are so many things that little kids can see .
Like at any @LOCATION1 or any where there are magazines with ladies in there bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys .
I dont think its right they should they them put up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see .
Those kind of things are justy going to get kids asking question that make the parents have to lie .
Then theres kids watching tv and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are on there cusing and talking aboout sex then your kid goes to that channel when your not around hear all these stupid stuff .
Then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it .
When you can just take channels like that off your tv and make everything easier .
I think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that .
I would never let my kids listen to music like that i don't care how old they are .
I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are from the music they want to listen to its horrible .
I would do anything to make it where kids coudnt listen to that stuff until their parents didnt care .
I know my parents didnt like me listening to it when I was young and I see why now that im older and know what all of it means so i 'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age .
In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way .
Why let are kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the longt run it just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want .
