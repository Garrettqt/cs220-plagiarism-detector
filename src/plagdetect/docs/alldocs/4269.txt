Censorship in libraries differ in certain areas .
I personally love reading , and like all kinds of books .
And I know that there are some books that I have read that my parents would not aprove of .
But has that ever stopped me ?
Not exactly .
I think that after a certain age , people should be aloud to read whatever they want .
I mean , if I ever thought I could not be mature enough to read a certain book .
Then I will not get or read the book , it is that simple .
As far as music , movies , and magazines go that could be a different story .
Music is for the most part like a book , just using a different one of your senses .
And it is listened to , not read .
Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes , because movies are like show and tell .
That could easily go wrong if children , teens , etc take it more than just a movie .
I think all things should not be judged by assumption .
Everyone has different opinions and likes .
So , therefore material should not be removed from shelves , if there are people that like/support what the book , movie , or music has to offer .
