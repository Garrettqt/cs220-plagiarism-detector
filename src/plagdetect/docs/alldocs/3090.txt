They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf .
But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor , then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf .
But then , they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read .
They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive .
This is what they should do about books that are found offensive .
If kids were reading books that the author found offensive , they should get rid of them .
The books that were found offensive should not be read at all .
Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read .
Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at .
If you are going to read a book , do not get a book that is offensive .
Non-offensive books like @CAPS1 , those kinds of books are not very offensive .
If books were not offensive , people would read them very often .
If people were to read books very often , there would not be enough @CAPS1 to do anything else .
We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them .
People deserve to have better and not offensive books .
Every day we read books , but do we know if they are offensive .
If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive , then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying .
If we say stuff right out of the offensive book , we would get in severe trouble .
Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment .
When you get punished , it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @CAPS1 .
In conclusion , you understand what you can and can not read .
You also understand about what to do with offensive books .
That non-offensive books can make you learn something .
You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books .
And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @CAPS1 .
