Books , magazines , movies , music , etc , are all good to read , watch or listen to .
When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes .
I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music , read books watch movies are so offensive .
In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people , talkin about people , with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music .
I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed .
Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music .
When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else .
I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves .
The reason i say is because movies are funny , scary , sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie , with out that it would not be good most of the time .
One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission .
That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character .
Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good
