You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2 ?
Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today .
People ask , ' @CAPS3 much should be censored ? '
or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all ? '
@CAPS4 opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading , listening to , or watching materials .
Television networks and reading companies , including publishers and libraries , can't possibly take the place of a parent .
I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care @CAPS1 the child is reading , the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished .
In @CAPS4 experience , @CAPS4 mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age .
She is always interested in @CAPS1 I am reading .
Occasionally , she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to @CAPS2 .
@CAPS4 mother has also censored @CAPS4 music by glancing through @CAPS4 music player and every so often , playing a song or two .
@CAPS9 discourages me from listening to anything that @CAPS4 mother wouldn't approve of .
I have also experienced censorship in @CAPS4 local library .
The library is divided into sections , begining with the children's books .
These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material .
@CAPS9 section leads to young adult , then eventually the adult books .
The music is also similarly divided into these catagories .
I believe @CAPS9 is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to .
Through reading the book ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' by @PERSON1 , I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in @CAPS1 their children are reading , listening to , and watching .
In @CAPS9 book , @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room .
They let him listen to his own music , and watch @CAPS1 he wanted .
@CAPS9 led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called ' @CAPS7 @CAPS8 . '
@CAPS9 band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school , killing ten students .
@CAPS9 is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all .
Violence can have a large impact in young kids ; therefore , they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature .
Through @CAPS4 reading , I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population .
The novel ' @CAPS10 @NUM1 ' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme .
Reading is banned in their society , except for comic books and sex magazines .
@CAPS9 shows that without a right to @CAPS2 , society is reduced to very simple , uneducated creatures .
Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical .
@CAPS4 opinion is that once a person is an adult , they have the common sense and maturity to @CAPS2 whatever they choose .
Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider .
@CAPS4 position on @CAPS9 vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading , not the government or the reading companies .
Once a person is an adult , their right is to choose whatever they like to @CAPS2 .
Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest .
As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 ' in which censorship was not practiced , and ' @CAPS10 @NUM1 ' in which it was enforced to the fullest , I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance .
Censorship is healthy for children , but restricting in adults .
