Censorship ?
Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it ?
Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf ?
Well if you have , you have experienced censorship .
Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day .
A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries .
Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines .
A big question I ask is why ?
Well I can tell you why .
Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think .
Everything and everyone has to be perfect .
I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book , they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it .
If they do not like it , then do not read it .
I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people .
If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it , you are going to stop and read it .
If it has a good message to send to you will think about it .
Then once you have thought about it , you will make your own opinion on what that article said .
If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it .
If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there .
If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it .
That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it .
I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently .
The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you .
