NO , I dont think music.movies.magazines , and etc.
, should be moved from libraries because whats a libaray with only books ?
In even though you have to read and be quity and be seated .
You can have music while on the computer and you can watch and check out movies you @MONTH1 like .
And the magazines to keep you updated with the newest fashion on new looks or something thats going on and our community.Music is what you wont to listen when you come to the libary .
It smoothing up the vibe and if you @MONTH1 be and a bad mood that music you @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 claim you down in put you and a better one .
It relax you .
You can be on the computer and still listen to music .
While reading a good book you can be listing to music.Movies is a good source when and the libary .
You can watch movies while and the libary and check some out .
In take home and watch .
You can watch all types of movies .
Movies you @MONTH1 like and it also can be movies you @MONTH1 need for a project or even educatoinal movies .
If you wont to leran about nature , animals , or even a @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1 .
Its always good for a movie and the libary.Magazines and a libary is very helpful .
Because while you @MONTH1 be waiten on something or it could be on the computer you can seat and grab a magazine .
In the libary its a varity of magazines you can read like sports , fashion , nature , cartoon , animals and etc .
So magazines is very helpful and a libary.Thats why i say no , because it shoudnt be removed from libraries becouse you can do lots of great things and the labary besides just reading a book and getten on a computer .
Movies magazines and music is helpful and a libary to .
Who just wont to get on a computer and read a book .
