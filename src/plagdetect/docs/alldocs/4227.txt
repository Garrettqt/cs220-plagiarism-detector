Why would you ever censor anything in a library ?
Apparently because things such as books , music , movies , magazines , ect .
can be found offensive .
If something is considered offensive , why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public , including children ?
First off , censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places .
Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature .
Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive .
If a book is offensive , first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to .
Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience .
If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience , then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library .
Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library .
Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature .
As mentioned before , if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience , it should be placed in an adult section .
Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section .
You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers .
Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship .
Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them .
In conclusion , sections in a library can be used instead of censorship .
If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody .
Sections help keep books in a library , but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them
