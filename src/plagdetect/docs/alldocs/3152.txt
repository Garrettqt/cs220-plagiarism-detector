I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays .
Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For , me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city .
Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also , provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper , but online .
Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also , I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them , however if everyone found something offensive in the book , movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed ?
If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books .
I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive , but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other .
In conclusion , I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive , but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it
