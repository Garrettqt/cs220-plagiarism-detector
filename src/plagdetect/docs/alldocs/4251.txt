Devin @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Do you like the libary ?
There is always an argument about how books , music , movies , magazines , ete.
, should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive .
Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ; there is always the choice of a different libary to choose from .
You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie .
Being an @CAPS3 author you have the freedom of speech , you can write whatever you feel like writing .
First , is your choice of libary .
There is sevral different libraries in one town .
Some have childern sections , where all the books are appropriate for young childern to read .
Also the parents of the childern need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading , or looking at .
There has to be at least twenty to thirty libaries in @LOCATION1 , so you always have a different option .
Second , you don't have to read the book , or watch the movie .
If you see something you don't like about the book , why complain about it ?
Just put the book down , someone else might be interested in the book .
You have the freedom to pick out the book .
Last , is the freedom of speech of the author of the book .
Being an @CAPS3 citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down .
So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down .
Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial .
Where would we be without those books and authors ?
I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries .
You have the choice of libraries , you don't have to read the book , and the author has the freedom to write what they choose
