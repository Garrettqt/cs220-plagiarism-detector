Censorship is not an easy question to anwser ; it involves a great deal of thought .
When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture .
You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else .
When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves .
So , why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't ?
If you don't want a child to look at adult books , then you can censor them by watching them , and not taking them to places that have such books .
This way other people can read these books .
If you truely think about it , then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can , and will , find a way of getting it .
If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more .
Books are good for people .
It tells them stories that can not happen , past events they did not live through , and even the thoughts of others .
Keeping books away from people is not good for them ; they would not be able to learn from the things they read .
So , maybe some books are more racie than others , that does not mean you should hide it from your children .
If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems .
Now you will have no books for some people .
You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children .
This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library , and people will stop going to the library all together .
So , when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books .
Books are good for people especially teens , whos minds are developing .
In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated .
When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from
