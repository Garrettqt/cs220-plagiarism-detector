What is offensive in libraries ?
The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books , music , magazines , movies , and other materials in libraries .
These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves .
They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writting .
From my own experience , I have seen innapropriate movies .
To me , I feel that they teach me some lessons , but , it also depends on what type of movie it is .
If it is rated @CAPS1 then I know that I @MONTH1 see some blood , gory scenes , and nudity .
If this type of movie is not @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , then I know that some of this stuff on the screen @MONTH1 happen in real life .
Most @MONTH1 not happen , but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world .
All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at .
In libraries , there should not be nudity websites , books , or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and innapropriate for any child to see , especially in a public library .
Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it , then it should stay on the shelves .
I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing .
So , as I ask again , what @MONTH1 be offensive in libraries ?
Some @MONTH1 say that books , magazines , movies etc .
with racial slurs are offensive ; but to others , it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be .
In my perspective , I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over .
That @MONTH1 be it , it @MONTH1 not .
In so many words , I say that the 'offensive ' books , magazines , music , movies and other materials should stay on the shelf .
For so many reasons I have said , and the ones I have not said , they help people learn .
