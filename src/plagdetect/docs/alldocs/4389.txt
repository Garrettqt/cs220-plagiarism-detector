I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive .
In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable .
People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it .
Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive .
Some books are racist ; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks .
If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i 'm older .
I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's .
Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read , if you find a book offensive don't read it !
When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it .
It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse .
We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while .
Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out .
Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that .
Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people .
I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out .
If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge .
Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries .
