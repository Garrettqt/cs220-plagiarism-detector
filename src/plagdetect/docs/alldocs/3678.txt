No , I do not believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive .
Here are statements on why i believe this .
First , I think if you are reading , listening , or watching any of these things then dont read the part that is offensive to you .
If you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it ?
If you believe this is offending you then put it down and forget about it , you dont have to read or watch it .
I think if you are reading or watching it , then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it .
When does anyone even write about offending things lately anyway ?
Like I said before if you are reading or watching or whatever it is then it is your own fault , @CAPS1 states that when one of you states you have been offended you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives.Well it stops today I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do .
If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things , then do it , but remember of what your taking away from those who like to read all of that.If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us .
I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone.I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read , just think about your taking away from those who read , listen or watch these things .
Take in order of what I have said , goodnight .
