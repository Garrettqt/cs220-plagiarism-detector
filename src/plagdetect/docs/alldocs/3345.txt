All of us have rights , all of us have the same chance to express what we feel , think or believe .
Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us : its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have .
As humans it is not easy to understand othe people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that extrangers from us can apport .
A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions , sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching .
If i had the right to remove any magazine , book or movie off the shelf , i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it , and if everybody else had the same right as me , the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library .
Music is a big topic to talk about , we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music ' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids .
I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like , the books they read or the movies they watch .
We need to understand nobody is better than nobody and we also need to respect other people's feelings , its something that we have to work on .
