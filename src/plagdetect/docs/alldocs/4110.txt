@STATE1 @NUM1 , @PERSON1 , IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson , I read your article in newspaper yesterday about offensive books in library .
I agree with you on this article .
Some of the books , music , movies , or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people.There can also be somw books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people .
Everyone have their own views and ideas on everything.The people of @LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something differrent to say .
There are some books or movies that children can not read or watch but children still do because once the child is in library he can read , watch , or listen to anything .
You can not depend on librarian because there are other people in the library too.The librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book .
In my point of view , library should have diferent sections for different kinds of movies , books , or magazines and there should be person assigned for every section .
This way children would not be able to go to older people's section .
If there are books that are found offensive by everyone , then people should write a letter to president to help remove those books from library.Yours @NUM2 .
