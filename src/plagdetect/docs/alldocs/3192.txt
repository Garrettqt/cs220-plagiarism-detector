When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me .
But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not think the same thing is offensive to him or her .
When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not .
There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history .
What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed , published , or recorded and other people's eyes .
The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition .
I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on .
There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups .
For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie .
Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense .
We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved
