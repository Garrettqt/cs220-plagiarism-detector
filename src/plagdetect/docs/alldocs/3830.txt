Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling ?
Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want , who has the right to tell us what we can watch , read or even listen to ?
As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship .
Kids today need to be able to read what they want , to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life .
The so called 'banned ' books are some of the best anyone can read , as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want , wether it is offensive or not .
If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that , but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen .
To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard .
Music and television i understand some censorship , i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the ' @CAPS3 bomb ' or seeing anythin obsene , but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media .
Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad .
If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer .
Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4 , but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction , classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6 ' , or educational litterature .
So is our reading choices becoming scarese ?
Yes i believe so , na it all has to do with censorship .
We cant read some of the classics because the 're 'racist ' or are 'pornagraphic ' , but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't .
so let everyone read what they want when they want .
