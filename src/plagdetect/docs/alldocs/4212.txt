Certain materials such as books , movies , magazines , and comics can be offensive to certain people .
When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive , what @MONTH1 seem offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to anyone else .
Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you @MONTH1 be completely something else in someone elses eyes .
How many humans inhabit the world today ?
About @NUM1 billion , researchers say .
If you think about it , each and every one of those @NUM1 billion minds thinks differently .
If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant , it is like taking away a person's ability to learn .
In the world today , many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved .
What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world .
For all you know , the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer .
How could you just take that away ?
Again , the magazine could be offensive to a person who @MONTH1 have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer , but will they be offended when their cancer is cured ?
Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away ?
If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people , we might as well just take all the books , movies , magazines , and comics away that have ever been created .
Once again , something that @MONTH1 be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person , because about @NUM1 billion minds do not all think alike .
If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive , our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well .
