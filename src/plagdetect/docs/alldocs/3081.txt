What do you want your child being exposed to ?
In my own opinion I believe that @CAPS1 shouldn't be taken off the shelfs , because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them .
This @CAPS2 why the library has @CAPS3 'kids ' selction away from the 'adult ' selction .
They know their boundaries , and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate .
The library @CAPS2 a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out .
Also , @CAPS3 not just librarys ' , @CAPS1 can be seen or heard from schools , on the radio , t.v .
and video games .
Any where you go they 're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place .
So as a parent @CAPS3 your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible .
The only way a child can be exposed to this @CAPS2 if their parents are unattended and irresponsible .
Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students .
Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter .
I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games , music about drugs , alchol , and sex .
@CAPS1 really bothers me , because when I was their age I had no idea what @CAPS1 even was or meant .
@CAPS1's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know @CAPS1 has a label on @CAPS1 saying ' @CAPS10 @CAPS11 ' , ' @CAPS12 ' or ' @NUM1 ' .
Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs , violence and etc , the children tend to get younger and younger every time .
I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff
