Dear @CAPS1 , @CAPS2 the world there are people who censor what their people read and write , these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments .
Here in @LOCATION1 we have the right to say , read , and write what we want , about anybody or anything .
Censoship does exist in the @LOCATION1 , and it is in the form of opoion that it exists .
I have read artricles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth , due to what is politicaly correct .
I have heard of libaries taking down books that have a very strong political opoion , often these are books written by conservitives.I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming , proabable presidential nomanees .
Being a conservitive myself , I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores , libaries , or other public venues .
I believe this because in @LOCATION1 we have freedom of press and , for these books not to reach the public is against that right and , the free-flow of ideas.You @MONTH1 ask way I believe this ?
I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas , on how to obtain life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Now that @PERSON1 , is why all books should be in our libaries.I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored , so little children will not get a hold of @NUM1 I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts .
We the @ORGANIZATION1 are a republic , and we for over @NUM2 years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas.Why stop now ?
thank you @PERSON2
