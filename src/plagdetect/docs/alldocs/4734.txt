Todays world is filled with rasicm and critisim .
Anything we do is either right or wrong , no inbetween .
Whenever your out to eat , or shopping you can hear offensive comments or images all around you .
The newspaper , news , and internet make events appear worse than what it is , if it refers to certain people they take it offensive .
If you go out looking for a good book to read , or a movie to watch , or music to listen to laying in bed , you pick what interests you .
When your looking through the selection you 're going to see and reconize titles , or pictures that offend you .
I know when I do I pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back .
In someway , someone , is going to find a movie , music , books , or magazine offensive .
Say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people .
What would be on the shelves ?
Nothing , @CAPS1 have to right to write about anything they want , singers have the right to sing about what they want .
In the @ORGANIZATION1 every single person has the freedom of speech .
So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone @NUM1 it offensive .
That's the point of the different genres of music and reading , so you can read and listen to what you want .
Every @CAPS2 has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read .
If someone finds something offensive , then they shouldn't pick the object up .
Then , when that person complains about it , the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it .
There's going to be offensive things said about race , culture , looks , and weight .
That's just apart of life and how people act anymore .
There ;'s just a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on .
So , no I do not believe that offensive books , music , or magazines shoulkd be removed from libraries or stores .
We have the choice to pick what we read and listen to .
