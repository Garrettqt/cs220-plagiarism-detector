Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs ?
Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture , or have their own opinions ?
Where's that one place where you can experience all of those ?
In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs , culture , or opinions .
In a library you have the right to have an open mind .
I believe that any kinds of books , music , movies , magazines , or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings .
For example , if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1 , and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf .
If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries , we wouldn't have any libraries .
If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements .
Everyone could express themselves everyday , in their own way
