I do not beleive that certain materials such as books , music , , movies , magazines and ect .
should be remove , unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books .
Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids .
But i think we should have anything , that teaches you something in the labrary .
plus people have to do reports and homework on some books , and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books , movies , music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book , or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission .
The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones .
Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have .
So it just depends on the situation .
There is a lot of offensive things out there , it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people .
They will find out anyways sooner or later .
I think its unnessary for the libraries to do that .
I always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be @NUM1 or older or have an adult with you .
plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess , so they cant look up things easly .
They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library , but if they dont that sucks .
So thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves .
