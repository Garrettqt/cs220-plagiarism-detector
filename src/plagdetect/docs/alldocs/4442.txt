A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book .
After an hour of searching I decided on one .
I was happy with my choice as I checked it out .
As I anxiously started reading my book , I found language , drug abuse , and sexual content .
As a teenager , I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material .
No one should be exposed to that , and because of that experiance , I believe that censorship in libraries is a must .
Due to sexual content , drug abuse , and vulgar language , one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated- @CAPS1 movie .
I believe that since that is true for movies , it should also be true for books , magazines , and music .
@CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age .
The world exposes certain literature to children , and then is shocked when they see children in jails , gangs , and other horrible situations .
The world has set their standards too low , and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps .
Author , Katherine Paterson once said , ' ... if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else . '
@CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come .
Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine .
As a daily newspaper reader , I could not quiet my voice any longer .
I had to step-up and say something .
I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way .
The first step to changing that is to set the standards high .
Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to .
Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves .
If libraries censor materials , then next time I wnat to find the perfect book , I will .
