Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library .
America is a free country and we can write whatever we want .
Everyone has freedom of speach , your just taking that admendment and putting it into music , books , or a movie .
When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on .
Everyone have seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs .
You hear jokes that are offensive but that is all that it is a joke and it is not to be taken seriously .
I have read a book recently called ' @CAPS1's your @CAPS2 ' it was not what I thought it would be , so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading .
If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive would we have any books at all ?
Movies have a protection against this called ratings .
The ratings are from ' @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 . '
If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes .
That is why there is always a blocked off section at a dvd rental store .
That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older .
If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds somthing not suited for him and you really get fired up just think @CAPS1 let him wonder into that section .
@CAPS1 should be watching him at all times , @CAPS1 is responsible for him ?
I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf .
Thats like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded they could just take it down and throw it away .
We would have nothing to read .
So the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on
