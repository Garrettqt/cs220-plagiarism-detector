We all enjoy having the freedom to read , listen , and watch what we like .
How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you ?
Some people believe that censored books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from libraries .
I believe you should have the right to read , listen , and watch whatever you choose , but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material .
We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read , see , or listen to .
That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though .
Instead , the child should talk to a parent about the censored item .
The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item .
Also , if those materials are removed from libraries completely , someone that is mature enough to be reading , listening , or seeing it will not have a chance to .
I remember when I was in middle school , I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library .
My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age .
My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of .
She said when I was older , I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted .
I found this compromise to be very fair .
I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels , they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me .
We should have the right to read , listen , and watch what we enjoy , but younger children or other age groups should be monitored .
That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though .
When those children are old enough to read , watch , or listen to those materials , they should be able to go to the library , knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them .
