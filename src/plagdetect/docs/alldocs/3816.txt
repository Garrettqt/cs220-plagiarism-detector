Should books , music , movies , and magazines be removed if found offensive ?
Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone , who goes to that library , to decide .
That some might not find it offensieve as others do .
No because people have different beleafs than others .
I think they should be put to a vote for everyone , who goes to that library , to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive .
But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff .
The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do .
Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently .
No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks .
the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason .
Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life .
No because people have different beleafs then others .
In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library .
So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books .
For example , if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers .
Their business would fall .
The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money .
So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote , some might not find it as offensive as others do , and people have different beleafs than others do .
No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible
