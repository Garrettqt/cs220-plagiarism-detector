Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot ?
Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers ?
I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine , or even watch a movie , if they find it offensive .
'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self .
But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no book left on the self for any of us . '
@CAPS1 quote from the arthur , Katherine Paterson , from my opinion , I believe that what she is saying is very true .
Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things , if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self , there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from .
I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book .
They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible .
Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good .
So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book .
I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality .
Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books .
Everyone should get a large variety
