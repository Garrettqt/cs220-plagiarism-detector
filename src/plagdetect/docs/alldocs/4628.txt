Should there be censorship in libraries ?
Many people will answer this question differently .
I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries .
Allowing censorship in libaries is an intrusion of our rights .
It contradicts freedom of the press .
If someone wants there opinion to be read they should have that right .
I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speach .
What is writing , but written speach ?
If someone wants to say something , they should be able to say it .
If a mute person wants to get a point out , they should be able to do so by writing .
What some people @MONTH1 consider offensive , others @MONTH1 not .
If someone finds it offensive , they should simply not read it
