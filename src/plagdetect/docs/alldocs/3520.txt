Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld , yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library , but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech , and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican .
Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library .
Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship , ever since I can remember I have been able to watch , read , and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right ?
Wrong , although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases , I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs .
I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be .
The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering , yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral , but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves .
To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they 're very reflections of themselves , after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting , a musical piece , or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech , and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear .
I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject , to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks , but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to .
to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question , 'should we censor material ' well yes and no I generally think that for every book , song , or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored , this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature , will not take away from the personel expression of the creators , and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it
