Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others .
Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves ?
There are some things that could be censored , and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored .
However , yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored .
I am going to tell you why they should be censored , and what should be censored .
The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up .
A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer .
There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored .
Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across .
I think a movie , book , or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across .
If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library .
As people can see library there are circumstances where a book , movie , or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information .
There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive .
If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no .
I just gave you some reasons why I would say that .
The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important .
