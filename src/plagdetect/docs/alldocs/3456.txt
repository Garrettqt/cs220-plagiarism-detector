I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive .
I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf .
Everyone , has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not .
Also , everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books , music , movies , magazines , and so on are apropreate .
Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on the book , so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language .
Therefore , I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs .
And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail , only if offensive .
The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language .
I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries .
Even thought alot of people will dis agree , this is what I believe should happen .
Heres why I believe this should happen .
One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book .
I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen .
I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it .
So , now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children ?
I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also
