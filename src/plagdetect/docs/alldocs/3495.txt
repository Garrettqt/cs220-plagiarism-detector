I believe that certain books , movies , music , and magazines should be taken off the shelves , to those who they are offending .
I myself have not come across any books , movies , or music that have offended me .
I believe that we should organize our books , movies , and music in a different way perhaps .
First of all , people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up , and do something about it .
Finding a way to reach a happy medium .
If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion .
If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies .
Secondly , there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books , music , and movies .
Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read , listen , or watch what we want to .
If someone doesn't like the movie we loved , and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers .
Lastly , to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me .
I believe we could organize our books , movies , music , and magazines in a different way .
Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions .
Just like rated @CAPS1 movies , or rated @CAPS2 video games .
Books and music can be organized in this fassion also .
It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around .
In conclusion , I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book , movie , or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart .
One , its not fair for people who are not offended .
Two , buisnesses will lose customers .
Three , there is a better way to solve this problem
