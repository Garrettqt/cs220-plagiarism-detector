Yes there are many things today that have censorship , but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out .
I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies , games , @CAPS1's , etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment .
If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it .
So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1 .
Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and , maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older .
So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people
