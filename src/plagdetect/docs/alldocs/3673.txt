At my point of viwe i think if materials such as books is offensive to the reader the reader shuld just leve the book allown .
Because other readers might just wont to read it.Same thing for music , movies , and magazines , or any thing else just because you fide some offensive it wont be right to take it away from @NUM1 , ooo of more people.Also i think if some is offensive to more then one person it shuld not just not be taking away right then in there we as people shuld step up in have a vote or talk about it about the problem.I think it just wont be right for us or to the rest of the wrold and then look at how much work the author hade to put in i never wrot a book but i also know it's not easy to do.Heres a example me and my family want out to eat but we dent no were to eat at so every body was thinking about pizzy but my big brother dent wont to so we dent go out to eat that night because of one person dent wont to thats not fair now is it .
So in my conclusino i dont think its wood be ringht to take some away because some body fund it offensive you just got to look at the rest of the wrold you just got to because it wont right to the rest of us .
