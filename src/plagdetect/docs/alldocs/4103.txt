Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages .
Some @MONTH1 argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf , but I beg to differ .
A library holds many books , magazines , movies , etc .
that can advance the knowledge of citizens .
Libraries can , and probably do , contain materials that are guilty of being offensive , but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this .
Instead , libraries should be divided into sections based on topics .
If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism , then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section .
How will children learn about what goes on in @LOCATION1 if they are not shown ?
Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early .
This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting @PERSON2's next drug scandal , but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way .
Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason .
What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy ?
This student should have no better source for information than a library .
The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic .
These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us , but to entertain us as well .
If a library removes a biography on the rapper , @ORGANIZATION1 , because he has a 'rocky past ' , they @MONTH1 lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today .
As Katherine Paterson said , 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us . '
If a library censors all of the material that goes throught the system , there @MONTH1 not be any books left to entertain ourselves .
Therefore , libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf .
