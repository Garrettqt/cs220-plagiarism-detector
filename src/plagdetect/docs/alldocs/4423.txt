I think what ever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inoproperate .
Books do not need to be like that because they are supposed to be fun for you and help you learn , yes you can have a little violence in an action/adventure book to get the mood of the character , setting of the story , and to understand it perhaps .
Offensive books can be okay at times , so if you have a comedy magazine , or book that is making fun of something or someone , it can be taken in a offensive way , or just a joke , and a none offensive way .
To most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf .
Offensive books to them , such as parents or maybe even friends , they can teach a child wrong , and that child @MONTH1 not learn the right way .
Kids when they are little , their brains are like sponges , so they learn , and remember stuff well at that age .
A child getting a hold of a book or being tought something from a book like that will most likley remember it .
I think those kinds of books should be taken off of the shelf because , kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff when its allready on television , and talked about .
They need the edicational books that can teach them , and prepare them for their uppcoming higher grade levels , so then they would have a fresh start on new words or grammer .
