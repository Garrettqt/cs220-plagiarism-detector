Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or can not read in the schools library .
The things they can not read are censored .
School systems have good reasons why they censor some book , and I agree with the cooperation .
The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs , profanity , and unaproperit situations .
How many schools have books that have racism in it .
Racism happens in books all the time .
In fact one out of fifty books contain racism .
The big book is ' @PERSON1 ' fin by @PERSON2 .
It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1 .
People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say .
Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read .
Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools .
It is up to the kids not to read them .
Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines .
The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books .
Do you say to blame them ?
I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things .
It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents .
I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth .
