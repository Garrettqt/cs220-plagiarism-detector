I think as long as the book ain't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it .
If its offensive I think they shouln't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing .
Also I think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves .
Parents or teachers wouldn't want there kids finding out bad words to say
