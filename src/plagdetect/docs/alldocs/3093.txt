If I owned or worked at a librarie , I would have books , music , movies and magazines that to many people are offensive .
But I would not have the offensive books , music , movies , and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area .
@CAPS5 I would keep that type of books , music or movies might you ask ?
Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book , watching the movie , listening to music .
If the type of book , movie , or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf .
Its that simple .
If parents get mad and angree because of these books , movie , and music don't let your children watch , read , or listen to them .
Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 , don't pick out a book from @PERSON1 .
Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color .
Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4 .
My questions is , ' @CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive ? '
@CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music .
People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one .
In my oppenion offensive books , music and movies should stay in libraries .
Just little and younger kids shouls not read , watch or listen to them
