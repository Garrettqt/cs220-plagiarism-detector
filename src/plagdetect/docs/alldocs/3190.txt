I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive .
Many people have there own taste in what they like to read , write and do .
Therefore , there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best .
Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive , but they @MONTH1 also entice the reader .
i personally love books about drugs , sex , and many other inappropriate things .
In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library .
If they took all inappropriate books out of they library .
What would i read ?
not everything can be just peachy kin all the time .
Its not in real life , so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true ?
I know i would'nt want to read that .
Just like books and magazines , every one has their own taste in music .
some like country , classical , metal , and maybe even rock .
If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry .
That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive , and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women .
if it can be played on the radio .
Why cant it be in a library ?
there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway .
Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects .
Many people are interested in these movies .
If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre , why cant you check it out of a library ?
Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent .
What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf ?
Fail ?
I know i would become angry if that would happen to me .
Keep offensive books , music , movies , and magazines on the library shelfs .
People will eventually see them , hear them , and watch them even if its not in the library .
Even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do
