Offensive metaerial like that should most definately be removed from the shelf .
What if a child finds it ?
They @MONTH1 think its the coolest thing they 've every seen .
Children shouldnt be able to access this kind of material at all , especially from a place like a library .
Sombody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is .
They @MONTH1 start reading it and not know what they 're getting into , but it would be there fault for picking it off the shelves .
This kind of material should only be places it is welcome , not in librarys or public places like that .
If the material was at a type of book store that was not meant for people under @NUM1 to go to , then yeah it is meant to be on the shelf because children aern't aloud in that building , therefore they can not see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or somthing .
Depending on where you go , if that meterial is on the shelf , say at a place that is not so public , and you pick it up and start reading or watching it , you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or case of the material .
If people want to get it they can , but it would be at there own risk .
There for if the consumer takes it off the shelf , its there risk of being offended .
There for they can not blame the place the material was at .
