AS WE ALL KNOW , ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL , BOOK STORAGE FACILITY , COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY .
ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA , BUT , IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE ?
MANY LIBRARIES @MONTH1 POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL , AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT ?
IN A MODERN WORLD , THERE 'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO OLD PEOPLE AND VIEWERS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING .
YES , I AGREE SME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS THAT MAINSTREAM MATERIAL , BUT ON A WHOLE , WHO CARES ?
I MEAN , MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DO N'T .
I KNOW I DO N'T .
CENSORSHIP IS STUPID , BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUFF IN LIBRARIES , IF YOU HAVE N'T HEARD OF IT YET , YOU WILL SOON , NO MATTER WHAT CENSORSHIP STEPS ARE TAKEN BY LIBRARY OFFICIALS
