I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf .
I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children .
This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about .
This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book .
I mean if it wasn ' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it , but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older .
Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at .
Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I 'm not going to let my kids listen to it .
Movies are just like magazines and music , if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it .
My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 , then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it .
So in the end , yes I can think of a book , movie , or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to .
And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch , look at , or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain .
I have to admit I have watched , listened to , and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so .
There are so many inappropriate books , movies , magazines out there in today's libraries , it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home
