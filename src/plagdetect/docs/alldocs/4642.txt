Dear Newspaper , I would like to start off by sayin that books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
are great for kids in libraries .
It's great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read .
But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults .
In high school just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know .
Many of them @MONTH1 not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs , alcohol , and sex .
Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent , like if they are medicinal drugs .
But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better , thats when its taken to far .
Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things .
Alcohol is the same way .
You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies , music , books , etc .
are promoting it basically .
Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things .
We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol , not how to get drunk and what you do when your drunk .
Advertsements are the worst things that kids could be seeing especially when they are on billbords , fronts of magazines , etc .
Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age .
Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride there bike .
I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people .
Because maybe its for the best that these things are taken off shelves beacuse maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol , etc .
Sincerely , @PERSON1
