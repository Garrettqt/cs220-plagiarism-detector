Many pepole think that offensive material should be removed from the libary because children could pick then up and look in them .
I do not belive this should be done .
They already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault .
I do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd , game , book , or movie they were looking for .
It is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose .
It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all .
These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate .
Who knows we might have to vote on it someday
