The problem in this situation is that , some people feel like some things shouldn't be in the library .

One family might be okay with their child watching certain movie , listening to different kinds of usic , and reading differnt genre's of books .

PLus the library would lose service because people would being to realize that some particular library ( s ) have restrictions on stuff that they have on their shelfs , so they wouldn't want to go there if they 're going to be let down on something that their looking for
