Throughout the history of literature , many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves .
They are all somehow offensive to certain people , but not to all .
Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies , simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds .
I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye .
When a book is banned , a piece of history is removed from others ' sight .
A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father .
My future children and I could also never be able to read it .
Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content .
When I was about eight years old , I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series , only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction .
Maybe they were being burned because the @CAPS5 looked down upon its story and its fictional stories , but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries .
The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation , and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did .
Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 , the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against .
They were treated as sub-humans , like in this example .
There was a night in @DATE2 called @CAPS12 , when radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11 ' houses , stores , and even books .
Some of those books could have been the only copies , yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @CAPS16 literature .
Because the @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS16 work offensive , the generations after @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 can never read the books burned during @CAPS12 .
In Katherine Paterson's quote , she says , 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else .
And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
I believe she is correct in this quote .
If literature keeps being censored , there will be none left for future generations to enjoy .
No literature should be censored , not even the most radical , magical , or fictional .
If censorship continues , the future of literature is doomed .
