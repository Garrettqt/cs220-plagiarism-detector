I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way , So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead .
Everyone has different taste in movies , music , books , etc .
If the music offends you , don't listen to @CAPS2 .
If a book does , don't read @CAPS2 .
Its as simple as that .
So I don't think they should remove the books , music , movies , etc .
That could offend someone , and here are my reason why ; If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day , then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble , I believe every person has the right to read , watch , or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to .
Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song , watch that movie , or even read the book or magazines .
Everyones offended in different ways from another , So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book , song , etc.
, offends a person .
I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2 , and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be , @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book , Also if he watches what movies he wants , he will learn that , @CAPS1 every body is good people .
Children read in a wide variety , some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 ' @CAPS2 ' .
Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read , listen to or watch .
The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women , or man in @CAPS2 .
Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that .
My @CAPS4 reason is , people have many different tastes in the materials , so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them .
What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also .
There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things , but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life .
In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive .
The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves .
I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended .
Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people , and things happen that people don't like but its life .
Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading , listening to , watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them
