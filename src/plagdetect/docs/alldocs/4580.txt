Yes , I do think so because everyone has an opinon to say and its something people like to look at or leason to .
Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff .
I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint .
I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something .
I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music .
So it shoukld not really matter what or where they go if you ask me
