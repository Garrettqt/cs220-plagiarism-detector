Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship .
Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it , but some other people @MONTH1 .
Also somebody @MONTH1 like the scary mystery books and movies , but others @MONTH1 not .
I think all movies , music , and books are acceptable .
I can understand why some people @MONTH1 want to remove some movies or books from the libraries .
They want to because they are inappropriate , but the thing is , they are not inappropriate to everyone .
A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book .
Personally I think that some magizines need to just stop being made .
For example ; @CAPS1 magizines are horrible to me .
There is nothing but nude women in there .
I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up , but there are other opinions .
Others @MONTH1 think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magizines , and it isn't jus magizines it's movies also .
More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies .
Everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want .
I think if you are offended by a movie , music lyric , book , or a magizine don't read or watch it
