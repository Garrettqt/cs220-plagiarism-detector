Should books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
be removed from libraries if they are found offensive ?
My opinion on this is no .
In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions .
I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day .
In some cases books , music , movies , magazines , etc .
@MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex , but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1 .
Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past , others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist .
Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes .
Here is exactly why I state this opinion , taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away .
I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been .
In conclusion , I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves .
After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory .
If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive , as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated .
I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past
