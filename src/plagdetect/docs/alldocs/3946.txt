When going to a library you expect to see various books , movies , music , magazines , and maybe other items .
If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race , culture , religion , or etc.
, they should still be able to check out that book .
Libraries shouldnt be able to control those situtations , because it's a persons choice or adults choice to read those kinds of stories .
In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the @CAPS1 .
The @CAPS1 includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters .
If a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so .
I 'm not condoning that someone should read books , listen to music , or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel , but by the law its ok for people to want to read , listen , or watch those works .
Libraries are government funded organizations .
Therefore meaning they dont have the right to disregard these works .
The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library .
This means they need books that people would want to read , and be interested in even though some gruops of people might not agree its there job .
I 'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music , but as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we are allowed to listen to what we want , and read anything we want , because thats what our country is meant to stand for freedom .
When I think of @LOCATION2 i think freedom , and i have to say I 'm proud our country stands for that , and we should stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life
