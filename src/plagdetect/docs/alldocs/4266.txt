Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had .
I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries .
I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day , but , i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live .
If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them .
I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1 , they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored .
some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books , but if they dont like something , they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics .
Also , some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion , I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people .
Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible .
