Do you believe that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , ect.
, offensive ?
Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince , observations , and/or reading .
I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get , if it's not for age group , don't get it .
Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children , they have sections for adults and children to check out books .
Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is a plcae with all types of books , so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book .
When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out , so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group .
By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age , magazines I didn't care to much about , I just wanted to read a whloe book .
In conclusion , when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section , make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge .
