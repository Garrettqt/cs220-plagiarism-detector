I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it , to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything .
sSome movies or books read or watched , should have an age limit too .
Some of the things people find offensive , other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books .
In alot of music some things might be offensive , but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group .
There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but , you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from .
It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see .
In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies , that alot of people @MONTH1 not know .
If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read .
