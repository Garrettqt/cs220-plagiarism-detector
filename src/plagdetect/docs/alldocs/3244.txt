Some books are not suitable for kids .
They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored .
These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to .
Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should .
I 've read books at school that were adult books at school .
Back in elementary school , I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books .
Some kids enjoy reading adult books .
It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them .
Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material .
I believe that this should take place at every library around the world .
