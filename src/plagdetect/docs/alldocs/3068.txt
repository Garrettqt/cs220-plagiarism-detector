I believe that if there are offensive books , music , movies , and magazines are in the libraries .
I think they should be taking off the shelf , @CAPS1 people should not want there children's reading or looking at thing they should not be looking at .
Today I 'm going againt the views on the censorship in the libraries .
I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read .
The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older poeple .
Not for the children's that go to the libraries .
I 'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on there shelf for our young people and are children's .
And what type's of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf .
We should have right's to take off book's on the children side .
And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books , music , movies , and magazines but not for young children to read .
The point I 'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children's should be learn .
And what they should know as a young person .
They should not grow up to fast like some people are .We need to make the better for our young children's .
So they can do the same for there self and for there children's some day .
