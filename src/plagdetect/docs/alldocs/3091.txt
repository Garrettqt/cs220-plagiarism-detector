The way that the books , musics , ect .
are made for people basicly for that age group .
Like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive , then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just of one book .
Some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have .
From my experience is that it's ok , but if it gets out of hand then I just leave it and go to the next thing .
Although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else .
The librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library .
So hopefully this might help the problem that you might have for people to enjoy that books , music , magazine , ect .
