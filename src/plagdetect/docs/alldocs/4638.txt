In the book fahernheit @NUM1 all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything .
Books are an improtnat part of our lives .
Some materials do need to be cencored because it might offend some people that are all ready have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame .
Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason .
There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored .
Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly .
We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time .
Music has been with mankind since the beginning .
Movies show us the ups and downs of life .
Magazines inform us on what new and interesting .
These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food .
Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live .
Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be .
Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one , but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say .
Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason ?
