I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the the students would need that information to look up ideas that they would need to write about in a report or to right in a final .
The reason the libary is here for the students to have and take there advantge to put time in to looking up what they need for their classes.knowing me I put the time that I need to do my work in class so i know what is need in the report so I know im doing it right and not just making up something that I could just stick in the report .
I see that it is imporant to keep the materials in the libary to have the convence to have thing that is needed to have to look up a celebrity that is inporant to keep in touch with .
If your writing in the news paper you are needed to the infomation that you can get your hands on to keep all the students informed in how there celebrity is living there live .
If students are ready to graduate and there needing to go on line to look up type of colleges that they could attend before leaveing @ORGANIZATION1 so they could be prepard to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a live and acomplish thing that our parents didnt get to do .
The intrest of the libary to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read book that can show the situation on how your health benifits are by looking in the cancer book for information from how the sun and going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by makeing your self look older by gettingas tanner .
I think the situation of the libary is to be use to for our education and our benifits to learn more from book and reading it a lots interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a tv show or even movies that show all the action in a movie that you can get from a book with more details
