I think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for .
If we started putting movies in the librarys why put books in the libraries .
I think it should be one or the other .
If movies were in libraries i think that people would get more movies than books , and just think how it would be if you put music in a library also .
I do think that a magazine is a book .
Movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater .
not in libraries .
Music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries .
People would lose intrest in books if people started putting movies and music in libraries .
I think they are trying to put technology in libraries and im not for that .
If music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books .
We need books they are the oldest but most acreart way to express yourself or tell a story .
but now they want movies or music .
