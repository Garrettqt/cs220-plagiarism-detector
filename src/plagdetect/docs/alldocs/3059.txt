Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are offensive to peoples belief's , their religion , their race and just their ways of life .
Therefore , i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored .
I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others , but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours .
Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves ?
Also , taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite .
If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it .
You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book .
There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive .
Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything .
The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world .
So if anything , the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says .
As far as movies , they are already rated on a decent scale .
If it is not age approprite , then do not watch it , or let your children .
The same applys for video games and music .
Censor them from your children , and do not get them censored from the whole world .
That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries .
Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes , does not mean that someone else in the world does not .
Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them .
Of all the places , taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done
