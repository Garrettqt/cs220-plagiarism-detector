Every person is different , and in being different , people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive .
Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else , it is all a matter of values and beliefs .
Libraries contain a variety of books , music , movies , magazines , and other materials on a variety of topics , some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone .
I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive .
The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine , listen to that music , or watch that movie .
Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy , not just to please certain people .
I do beleive , however , that materials should be clearly sorted in a library .
If they are clearly sorted , people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident , and can completely avoid books , movies , magazines , and music that they do not to read , watch , or listen to .
This can also help keep children away from unwated material .
To conclude , materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive .
What is offensive to one person , another person might enjoy watching , listening to , or reading .
It is impossible to please everyone , because every person has different veiws , but a situation can be avoided by careful organization .
If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves , there would be nothing left
