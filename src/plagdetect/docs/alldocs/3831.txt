'Do you bleieve that certain materials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ? '
No , I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does .
Everyone has a different opinion , we 're all different .
We need variety of all books , music , movies , magazines , etc .. Censorship is understandable , in some ways .
Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice .
Your opinions , decisions , outlook on life yourself is one of a kind .
How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book ?
Exactly , that doesn't make sense right ?
If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment .
In my opinion ; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic , subject , etc .
then leave it alone .
It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion .
Be open minded !
Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt .
It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong .
Individuals should all have individuality .
Without variety , how is that possible ?
From music , books , magazines , movies , etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree
