I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves .
I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book ?
I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school .
I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not .
Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books .
It should not be a big deal on what there about .
If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it .
So , i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies .
If the people don't like it then they can leave , and don't have too worry about it .
That is what i have too say about that problem .
I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit
