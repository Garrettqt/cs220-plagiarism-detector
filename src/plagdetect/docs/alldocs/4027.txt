I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove .
I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better .
Kid's dont like reading boring books .
Things like music , movies , and magazines are interesting to us .
If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books .
Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story .
Some kids like listening to music while reading .
I 'm glade people invited these thing's .
I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring .
Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on .
Magazines are entataining to people .
I say they are because they have pictures , glossip , and much more .
Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better .
It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine .
Some books are good some are bad .
I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures .
Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things .
Hope you get something out of what i wrote .
This is how i feel about books , magazines , music , and movies .
I love to read and listen to all of them .
I enjoy books alot .
