The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years .
It has been discussed by many people , but a decision has never been reached .
I say that there should be no library censoring .
I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are .
I think that there should be no censoring of libraries .
It would impair our basic rights .
Such as our right to freedom of expression .
And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state .
Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators .
I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed .
Thus , if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age .
Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries .
It's the parents who introducee the children to music , magazines , and books .
If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is .
The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years .
Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice .
@PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us .
