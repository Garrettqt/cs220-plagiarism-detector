I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries .
There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems , but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others .
There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library .
Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books .
What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books , or movies you can find in libraries ?
Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence , horrible language , and sexual innuedo ?
What can you do about this problem ?
You could censorship the books and hide them from the public , but that would cause another problem .
The idea of censorship might sound ok , but really it's not the right thing to do .
Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top .
If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you 'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books .
Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read .
So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf ?
Do you just leave it there , or take it away so no one can read it ?
You could just put age restrictions on the books .
If someone underage wanted to check out the book , they would have to get permission from their parent .
That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone
