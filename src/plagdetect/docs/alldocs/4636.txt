People should have a right to listen , read , and watch whatever they want .
It is people's own choice to what they read , watch , or listen to .
They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books .
They will only go somewhere else and do it .
People have a right to read , listen to , and watch what they feel is good for them .
If others find that offensive then that is their problem .
People make their own decisions and that is their right .
I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more .
Taking offensive books , music , movies , and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others , it will only mask it .
Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others , they just won't do it in libraries .
Every book , music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read .
It is just something that we will have to deal with .
So I do not agree with censorship in libraries .
It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have ; which is almost every book .
Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries
