Im alot of things but i am surley not a reader.But i do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic .
weather that be a grafic novle or a didry maggazine .
nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offencive if it offends you dont pick it up or much less read it .
Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting , i would still be able to write it and sell it .
anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it .
instead why dont they just get over it ?
we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them , and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for .
Call me old fashoned but , I beleive in freedom of speach and the freedoms that we have lost solders over and the freedoms we have every single day we live .
I think drinking every @DATE1 of the week is wrong but , you dont see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they dont like .
so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldent be able to change , thank you for taking the time to read this .
