Many places show and sell offensive material .
It is found almost everywhere .
Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way .
So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed .
Take music for example , there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf .
Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it .
Movies @MONTH1 be different .
For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material .
But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was .
Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it .
Books @MONTH1 be the only exception .
Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive .
Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting .
But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about .
which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else .
There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you can not look at something .
All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision .
