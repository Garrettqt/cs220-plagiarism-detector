I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it , but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others .
However , if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it .
So what i 'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book is going to be out of sight , therefore making the issue non-existant .
I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see , I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read .
I 've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i 've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable .
The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge , without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole , due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be .
So no , I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem .
