I do not believe that certain materials such as books , music , magazines , ect should be removed from the shelves .
Libraries or any place else .
I believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them .
Imagine if the Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away , many people wouldnt bother to go to either .
The @CAPS2 in my eyes is a place that shows me where we have been , what we have been threw , and things we have accomplished while we have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past ?
, 'No , I couldn't .
Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes , it could be the history of anothers .
Many people now days relie on the useage of the magazines , books , and music to get information from .
I believe that everyone has a right to know what has happened in their pass to have gotten to their future , so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone else isn't fair .
I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries , @CAPS1 , art shows because everything has it's on history behind it , and if we just cover it up we will never know .
I myself , 'would want to know , than not to ever have known . '
