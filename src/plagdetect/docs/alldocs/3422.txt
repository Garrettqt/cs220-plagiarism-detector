I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and say this and that shouldnt be aloud here .
I also feel thats if you dont like the book dont look at it .
Or read it .
I mean I kind of understand about the magazines becouse somethimes there can be pretty bad .
I mean at the same time its noones job to say what is right and what is wrong .
The music I am @PERCENT1 with it being taken out of the libraries .
some of the music people lisson to today is just not right or kids or adults .
People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today .
The movies at the libraries are pretty good they dont let thim get to bad i cant compain to much about that .
All around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it .
Just some stuff that I would change but really what I think doesnt matter .
Im only a @NUM1 year old kid i mean I can give my thoghts about it but thats about it .
I love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going .
If I dont like something thin i just dont read it or look at it and thats how everyone should be
