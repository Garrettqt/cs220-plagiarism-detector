All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age .
The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first .
I think that some , but not all , reading materials such as books , music , mvies , should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material .
Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs .
If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books , less children would pick up the wrong book .
If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books , less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur .
If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf , I would think that their parent ( s ) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child ( s ) .
If parents would be responsible for taking action , their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf .
Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back , that they would learn not to do it again ?
I think that some , but not all , reading materials such as books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material .
