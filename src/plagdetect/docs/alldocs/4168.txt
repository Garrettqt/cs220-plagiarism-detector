This is a very difficult topic to argue with .
In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries .
Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc .
This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries , but of course you wouldn ' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library .
Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children .
If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to .
If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life .
It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all .
There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure .
Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books .
There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries .
Even you should know what belongs or doesn't .
So as I come to my conclusion , there should be things like music , books , and magazines but leave out the graphic material , children don't need to see that kind of stuff .
It is all your own choice of things you want to read .
Just make it the right choice , and understand what your reading , watchin , listening to , or being around .
