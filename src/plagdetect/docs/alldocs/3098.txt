Do I belive that some books , movies , magazines , or ext.
, shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive ?
NO , I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive .
Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work .
Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive .
Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking .
The students go to the libraries to get some books on it .
Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch .
It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive .
The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from .
So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books , movies , magazines , or ext.
, do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive .
