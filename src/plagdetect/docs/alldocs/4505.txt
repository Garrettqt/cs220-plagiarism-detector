Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear .
I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but , there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see .
They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library .
I had an experince like this once .
I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me .
I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him .
He got his shoes on and he ran to the door , he was so excited .
We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors .
I chased after him , when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that .
We went inside , it was a giant library .
He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read .
I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it .
Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at , so I went with him to go see the book .
He handed it to me and I just lost it , the book was not a children book at all .
I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen , we left the library and never came back .
I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library .
This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there .
This is what I think sould be done to all libraries
