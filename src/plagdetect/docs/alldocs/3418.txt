Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 , I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive .
There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book , movie and/or @CAPS3 case , or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says .
We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say .
@CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them .
The seller could also make an edited verison of the book , movie , @CAPS3 , or magazine .
The sayings , 'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7 , than @CAPS5't look .
'
, ' @CAPS5't got anything nice to say , than @CAPS5't say anything at all .
'
, and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7 , than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7 .
'
, strongly apply to this .
The way this world is coming to , @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product , as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product .
Now a days , @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is , the smarter @CAPS7 'll be .
If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case , saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head .
That child's gon na grow thinking , ' @CAPS7's okay to be naked .
@PERSON1 did @CAPS7 .
Why can't I ? '
.
Childeren learn more things from family and freiends , before they start learning the truth in school .
@CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 , half naked to naked woman just walking around freely .
Not something a little five-year-old needs to see .
Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien .
Having young childeren see , hear , say , think , or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads , making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want , while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural .
Although , this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents , but @CAPS7's not normal .
@CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake .
Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren .
Every parent wants the best for their child , they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong .
By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case , or by selling books that talk about murding someone , hiding the body , and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught , or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids , let's them think that they can sell whatever they want , promote their music where ever they want , makes the companies win .
I 'm not a mother , nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother , but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that .
i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked , or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word .
I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child .
As well , I strongly do believe in ' @CAPS13 of @CAPS14 ' , so the companies , in a way , do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is .
Just , if they really wanted to selll their product that much , that bad , than they should sell @CAPS7 online .
@CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more , but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7 .
Although , once you owned @CAPS7 , than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7 .
That would be on the parents plate to deal with .
Another thing with childeren , is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age , their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world , @CAPS7's kinda like their second home , only @CAPS7's inside their brain .
Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday .
Once they go to the store with their parent ( s ) , they 're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses , or just because they wan na run up and down the alies , @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty .
I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I 'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things .
So , for the childeren's sake , think of them , their minds , and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion .
Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up .
Thank You , @PERSON2
