Censorship .
If someone does not like what a book , magazine , movie , etc.
, shows then they should put it back up and not worry about it .
But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff .
Most people who do i personally think are immature .
Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings , because of nude statues and the way they talked .
A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today .
Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials .
Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it .
So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain .
The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people .
But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it .
Most of the time they aren't listening to the words , but just like the beat of the song .
Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wan na hear it and think it should be banned .
What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy .
Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures , but now that is what most people like and want to see .
You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people .
Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down , because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore .
That is what most likely would happen if the books , magazines , movies music , etc.
, were found offensive and were taking off the shelves
