Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go .
No matter how offensive they might be , there are many other ways to solve this problem .
I believe that certain materials such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive .
First off , many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not .
For example , many people have different intrests than others .
Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not .
For instance , one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy .
On the other hand , there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies .
This is something you can not change .
Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read , listen to , or watch .
Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy ?
There are other ways to solve this problem .
I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library .
For example , if something is thought to be offensive , then it can be placed with others like it .
These materials do not have to be removed completely .
Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive .
If these materials are seperated from others , there will not be a problem .
Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library .
All in all , there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests .
In conclusion , I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive
