Libraries are very educational .
They provide books , movies , magazines , music , and computers for you to locate something you are looking for .
I dont think that libraries include anything offensive .
If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them , then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution .
It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive .
I 've been to many libraries in my life and personally , it's amazing all the books , and things for you do there .
I 've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i 've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing .
Never , have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else .
Everyone is different though , we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique .
If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed .
I personally , think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i 'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed .
If someone came up to me and said 'hey , i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to ' i would say , 'well , that @MONTH1 be true , but some children do listen to that music , it wouldnt be fair to remove it , just because one person doesn't like it .
Now , from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally , i think it would be outside of a library
