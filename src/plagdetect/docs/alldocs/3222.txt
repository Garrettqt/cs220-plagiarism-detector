Do I think materials , such as books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive ?
Yes I do beause why keep it on ther if it's offensive to young kids and other people .
If it dosen't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on ther .
Its sertin things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a sepreat section from the kids section .
They shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violents in it because the kids now days have to much violents as it is.The only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it .
So I think you should put books , music , movies , and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning maertails and things that would persuad them to do some in they life .
