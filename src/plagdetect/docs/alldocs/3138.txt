In libraries , there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer .
There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group , so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive .
In a public library , many children , who the books are censored for , are with their parents .
Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read .
Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous .
If an author spent time creating a story , it should be appreciated , and should not put on a list of no-nos .
If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation , all they have to do is not read it .
Even in school systems , librarians are there to guide kids to read good books .
If a child wants to read an inappropriate book , the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it .
In my experience , I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me , but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book .
Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books , but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet .
So trying to shield your child from the bad things @MONTH1 be a great thing , but the efforts are usually failed attempts .
It also never occurs to the people censoring the books , that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read .
The libraries , for some , are the main means for getting books .
To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves .
Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it .
If a person doesn't like a book , the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up .
