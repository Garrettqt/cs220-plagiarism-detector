BooksI think that every book in the world should be on the shelf .
because if it is afencive then dont read it .
it is alot beter if u can go read eny book u wat to .
and if thy dont have that book then i gess u gota go get it somwere else and some people wouldnt go thrue all that trouble for a book .
Wich means they wont know as much as they wanted to or could known .
we need smat people to know as much as there potential and as they wat and can posibly know .
But books are books not every body reads alot of books .
lets say u wanted to know somthin about a truck wat do u do u go find a book about it or get online or ask sombody that knows .
How would enybody know enything about it if the person that bilt the truck didnt write a book telling u about the truck .
You would haft to take it apart and find out your self wich isn't verry easy at all .
and if u mest up thats not good .
but if u had a book to go bye it makes thing alot simpler most of the time .
This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf .
so that if u need to know somthing and u want to learn u can read about it .
And find out wat u want to know .
Reading is one of the best ways to find out wat u are looking for so that way nobody is telling u wrong .
Plus books are just good to read Movies all movies should be there to because every bodie has the right to wach eny movie they want .
Inles they arnt of age .
and if no parent haft to say its ok for them to wach it .
If it afends u dont wach it .
Magizines @CAPS1 are good to i read alot of magizins u can find alot about enything in a magizine .
so ya the are good
