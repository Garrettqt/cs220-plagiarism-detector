REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA .
I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE , THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD .
THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS .
BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP , THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED , TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND , FREEDOM OF SPEECH .
BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS , WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE .
WITH BOOKS SUCH AS ' @DATE1 ' , KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK .
@NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE .
LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX .
WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER , ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ .
ALSO , WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS , IT WOULD SCARE A LITTLE BOY/GIRL OUT OF HIS/HER MIND .
WHEN GETTING RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS , WE REMOVE HISTORY .
THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DID NOT WRITE HER DIARY .
WE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD HILTER REALLY WAS .
WE COULD ONLY ASSUME .
WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE ' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON .
BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE .
BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE !
THINK : 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY ? '
FINALLY , FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THEY SHOULD SAY .
AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT .
IF THE READER DOES NOT LIKE IT AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE , THEN THEY SHOULD NOT READ IT .
IF SHAKE SPEARE , WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES , WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET .
SO MANY BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF SOMEONE COULD WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE .
BOOK THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE OR INAPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ THERE SHOULD BE A AGE LIMIT ON IT .
IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS WE GET RID OF CERTAIN HISTORY AS WELL .
GETTING RID OF THOSE BOOKS TELLS A NEXT COMING AUTHOR THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER TO OFFENCIVENESS .
SO KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND , ITS ONLY WORDS
