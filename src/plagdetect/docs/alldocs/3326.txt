I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves .
And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but , I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem .
I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them .
Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then , yes by all means remove them .
I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed .
I find it rediculous , but that is the way they parent their kids .
And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it .
I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive .
I see those books as our history , those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up .
What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult ?
People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words .
Why ?
If a book has a few curse words oh well , tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad .
But , do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library .
People have different views , we always have and we always will .
If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library .
Do not force your thoughts on some one else
