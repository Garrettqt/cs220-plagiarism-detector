I 'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper , so please take @CAPS1 easy on me .
Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation , taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken .
The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored .
@CAPS1 is almost like when watching television ; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way , that movie is way to scary for them , plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity .
If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1 .
In a library though , your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you .
So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to , or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course .
The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous .
Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1 : @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections .
Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side .
The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them
