censorship No , i dont think they should take certin book off the shelves , there are alot of thing out there that can be found offensive ; gangs , politics , race , even school that small children go to .
I can understand wanting to shelter your children , but you cant keep them from every thing .
Inner cities have gangs that right awfal words on trains , building , and about anything they possible can .
an you cant just take that off the shelf .
Politics can be the worst , during presidentual elections they are always bring up there color of skin , and about everything they can find out about the other person .
All of your kids watch this on tv .
Race wars can get bad , people all around the world are fighting just because the color of there skin .
You cant him them from it either , its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse .
I cant speak for other schools but mine has a lot of little problems ; little kids cussing , the older kids fighting , then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it .
You cant hide you kids for ever , sooner or later they will find out about these problems .
If you want to help your kids keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is alot better than them seeing it in the real world .
You have to prepare them for the problems ahead , and if you dont then they might get hurt alot worse than the little words in a book or a magazines or movies .
