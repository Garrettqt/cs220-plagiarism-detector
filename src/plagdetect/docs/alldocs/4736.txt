books , music , movies , magazine , ect .
shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read , seen , or herd .
they should stay only because these so called 'offensive ' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history .
it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway ?
there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them .
without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go .
that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library .
