In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive .
But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye , but are still there for those certin people .
If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made , because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some , but they are for everyone to see , which could be offensive to some .
I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you , and we would go and pick out a new book to read .
Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group , and should not be seen by kids .
Because once I was that little kid , and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read , but long behold that didn't happen , I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group .
So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again .
