libraries arcross the world contain all kinds of books , so good and some bad .
theres always gon na be something in a book that @MONTH1 offend the reader or someone close to the reader .
it just depends how sensitive people are .
the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs , relgion , and sexual content .
i think it should be the libraries choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down .
magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music .
according to some libraries are just trashed with vulgar , racial , or bad movies , books , ect .
if the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things , they need to put some sort of block on them .
if you want to rent bad things you should have to have parental permition .
taking all of these things out of the library is not a soulution .
all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more .
the library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids wont be able to get the 'bad ' books in there hands.alot of the nooks in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc .
it shows the mood of the story or how the charachter really feels inside .
if stories like ' @CAPS1 in The @CAPS2 ' didnt have anger , emotion , or the passion it has it would be a boring book .
authors put language , sexual content , and violence in books , movies , and magazines to entertain certain crowds .
if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read
