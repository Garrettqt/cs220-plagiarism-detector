Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together , but should be put in a section made for adult readers only .
This way no children would see the book anyway .
If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf .
All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience .
