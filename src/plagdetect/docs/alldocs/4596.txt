Diffrent books are mean't for diffrent people .
Yes , somtimes it matters when certain materials are not supose to be showing in public .
But , we need to know whats happening all over the world .
Even as we speak there might be a battle going on somewhere or somthing very importent is about to happen in other contrey .
We will need this informaion all the time .
There's this old saying that I read in a book once , 'You can not juge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it ' .
It took me awhile to understand what they mean't by that .
Then , I finely understood what they really mean't .
You can't juge someone by their outer looks , you must juge their inner personaltiy.When you look at a book , movie , magazines , etc.
, you can not juge it until you see it for yourself .
Compony people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love .
Tv shows , newspapers , books , etc .
All the things to make them happy.We must enjoy what we have in this life .
People always say that the world is going to end .
But it wont , for this we will live on in the after life .
