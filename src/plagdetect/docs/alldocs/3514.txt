The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon .
I remember when I was younger and I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people .
I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I 'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish .
Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions .
The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they 'd destroyed as well .
There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they 're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it .
But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '
