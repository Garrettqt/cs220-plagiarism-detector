People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't .
In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves .
If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section , the library is probably going to get sued .
Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have .
Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility .
Movies too , if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it .
Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1 .
If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed , then that shows that we deserved it .
What kind of movies we watch , advertisement we pay attention to , what music we listen to most , and many other things are what make people who they truly are .
People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad .
that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5 , these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8 .
These ads .
are totaly uncalled for .
If people looked into this more , than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much .
These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers , writers , and musicians .
These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive .
So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences .
