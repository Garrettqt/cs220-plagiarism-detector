What do you think about them taking books , music , movies , and magazines that are offensive ?
Everyone has a different look on it .
It is an important thing to think about .
Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around ?
Many would say no , because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens , and childern .
I believe that they should be taking off the shelves , and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason .
The biggest reason I think they should is , kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers , but really don't need to see that .
With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music , movies , to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool .
Young teenager don't think about what they are doing , and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it .
With magazines , and movies , and music they need to be of age to buy .
One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because , a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive .
There are a lot of different types , and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves , it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones .
I hope with reading my persuasive essay , I hope i relate to someone about the books , music , movies , and magazines that are offensive can relize what i 'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that .
With the a stuff I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves
