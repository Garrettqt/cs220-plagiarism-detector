In my experience some music is just too offensive .
They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages .
Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people .
Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see .
The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly .
One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library .
There was a @CAPS1 on a shelf and she put it in her @CAPS1 player .
It was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it .
I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age .
As soon as I put my ear to her head phones , I turned it off immediately .
They should really watch @CAPS4 music they put put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her , she might have picked up on some of those words .
I don't think @CAPS3 would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really .
It disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities .
One other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature .
I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine .
I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself , ' @CAPS4 if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking ? '
That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have .
I 've read somewhere that things children see at a young age , have a great effect on who they will become .
If this is true I certainly thing we should censor @CAPS4 we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library .
We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have .
We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read
