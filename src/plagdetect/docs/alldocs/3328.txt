In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries.I think that people are smart enough to make their decisions on what they want to read .
Their are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public .
The first reason why i think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is becuase it's showing disobedience .
The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority , and it 'll make many people have a bad review for that library .
The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it 'll change the whole enviroment of a library .
Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience .
I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude .
If people use profanity at home im a strong beleaver on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public .
Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion .
Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library .
Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves .
If a library is loud and obnoxious it 'll drive people away from the library .
I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming .
That 'll make the library much flow by easier .
At the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public .
A library is a place to go read , study , complete homework assignments etc .
And finally i think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can controll it
