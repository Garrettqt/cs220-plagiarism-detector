I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries .
If you think about it , there is a law called freedom of speech .
This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says .
Also , in my opinion , if you find it offensive , you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it .
I remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books .
None of these books really seemed offensive .
Then again , this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful ' books were at .
For example , some adult books etc .
These books were offensive .
They should not be banned though , they should only be moved .
On a different akasion , i remember walking threw the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at skool and i seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines .
I belive that these were put here for advertisements , however , they should be advertised in different areas out of site of kids and teenagers .
Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned , it would be quite difficult to accomplish .
I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like .
Instead , moved from one area to a different area .
For example , instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get there hands on , they should be at a higher level or behind the desk .
