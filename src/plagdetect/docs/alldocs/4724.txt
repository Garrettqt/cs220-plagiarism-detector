I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion .
If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them .
It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it .
If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place .
If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more .
So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more .
so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better .
If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music , movie , or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad .
My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right .
So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you .
As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them .
I find one exception to this rule cyotes ( we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest ) .
I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area .
So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv .
Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines , books and music .
