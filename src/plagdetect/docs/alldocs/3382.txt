There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature , movies , music , or etcetera .
I understand this , but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it .
Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance .
Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance .
Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about .
Watch at least one or two episodes of television show .
Before you make an ultimate decision about something , give it a chance first .
Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs .
If this is the case then just ignore it .
If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it .
Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it .
In conclusion , people should learn to give some things a chance .
They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive .
That said , I don't believe that certain media should be banned .
