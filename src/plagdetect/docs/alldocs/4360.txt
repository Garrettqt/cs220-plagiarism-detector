Censoring any type of media such as books , magazines , movies , or music from a library is not right .
A library is huge amount information put common places for people to seek out knowledge.When something is found offensive , you should not hide it a away as though it was never there .
If any media is offensive , it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it.When someone for example a child has something offensive , the first thought is to take it away from the library or television.Instead , just explain what it is there looking at and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive , but how does someone know what is offensive or not ?
Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away .
It should be talked about or discused by groups of people on the subject then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive.If there is a book or magazine on the shelve and it might be offensive it should a decision made by the people surrounding that type information to take it off the shelve and not to be hidden away .
