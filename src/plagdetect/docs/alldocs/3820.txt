Should books , magazines , music , and movies be removed from shelves , if found offensive ?
I think the answer is yes , as long as it offends more than a few people .
If it only offends a few people , then I think the answer should be no .
Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people ?
They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things .
It's almost like when people were segragted by race .
The segragation led to fights between the people .
How would you feel if segragation was still around ?
You might be upset and find it unfair , because you can not do some things .
That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media .
Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people ?
They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong .
They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong .
If there was nothing out there that offended anyone , how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong ?
In my opinion , it all depends on how many people are offended by it .
There are ups and downs either way it goes .
If you removed everything that offended anyone , it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves .
This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view , the point of view that is perfect for everybody .
The way I see it , that point of view does not exsist .
Therefore , I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone , we would not have a media .
However , if we did not remove anything that was offensive , serious issues could occur .
For example , fights could break out or wars could even start , depending on how many people were offended .
The last thing we need in our society is fighting .
So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no .
