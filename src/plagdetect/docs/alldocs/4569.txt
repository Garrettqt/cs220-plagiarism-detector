Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life .
Maybe its politics ; it could be a sports team .
Everyone has a right to their own opinion .
As for reading materials , the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear .
Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased .
People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library .
For instance , let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library .
The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read .
Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents .
To the grandmother , @CAPS1 is offensive .
Through observation , I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book ' and reads a little of it , they tend to put it right back where they found it .
It obviously isn't hard to do .
So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it ?
The same goes for music , movies , and magazines .
If you don't like the music , don't listen to it .
If you don't think it would be a 'nice ' movie , don't go out and see it .
If the magazine seems raunchy , don't buy it .
@PERSON1 said it well , that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf ' ... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us . '
@CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be .
What would be left ?
Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive .
Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves .
Whether or not you find a book , movie , music , or magazine that is offensive , why fret over it ?
It's just easier to move on and forget it .
Ignorance isn't all bad
