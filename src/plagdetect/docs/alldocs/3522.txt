People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it .
In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries .
One of the first things is our freedom of speech .
If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely .
Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion .
They have a right to speak for what they belive in .
Whether it be magazines , books , newspapers , movies , or music .
The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs .
Another reason is people's opinions .
Does one person really speak for an entire gender , country , culture , race , religion ?
Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power , someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from .
It is not right to deprive communication through these things .
A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it .
People think differently from each other .
Personal experiences are also have a place .
Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book .
Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song .
These help inspire people .
No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong .
All this things factor in .
No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom .
I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too .
