There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be .
The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age .
These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also .
The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than , then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing .
But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung ?
Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad ?
Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to .
That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis .
