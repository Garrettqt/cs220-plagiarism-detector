Yes I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this .
If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken off the shelf .
I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books , movies , music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place , also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education , growth and devolopement should be inspired .
My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf .
I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is .
