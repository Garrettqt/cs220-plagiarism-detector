If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive , I would want it removed , but then again I wouldn't .
Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things .
Mine are different from every one elses ' .
I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive , but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not , if you take it off the shelf ?
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion .
What we do , believe in , or think is what makes us ourselves .
Just because one person finds a book , music , or some movies offensive , doesn't mean everyone else will .
Others might happen to like it even if you don't .
Taking something away just because you think it is offensive , is like taking a little part of some one away .
It's like the school making kids wear uniforms , it takes our individuality away .
We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive , expresses some one else in some way .
There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like , but can you really just get rid of it all ?
It does not work like that .
You are not always going to have your way in life , but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it .
Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive , doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it .
Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like , but you can't change that .
It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier .
So if I found something offensive , I 'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help ?
