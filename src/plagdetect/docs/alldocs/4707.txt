There's bad , and good books out there .
Some people find different books affensive , to what they do .
Other's like the books that other people dislike .
In a way books are both bad and good .
Good , because people start to read better after reading a lot , and bad because a lot of people dislike to read .
I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read .
Children go in library's , what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits ?
Children , and adults have very different views on what to read .
Kids want to read fairytale stories , etc .
Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder , and such .
Yes , library's can let people check out any book they find interesting ; But , what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around .
It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere , kid's wouldn't form bad habits , or discover anything there not suppose to know .
Kid's are noises , and they will try to read your books , or see something bad on a magizine .
In library's , there is the children's section , and the adult section .
That helps in some way's , but your child can still find that bad book , etc at home .
Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's , or qeustions about that certain book , etc that they found .
It's good to just put thing's away when your done , and keep every bad book , etc out of your childs react .
Books are bad , and good .
You can find the information you need , or something you really don't want to read about , or see .
Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know , and want to know more about .
If your kid finds a misleading book , make sure they didn't read it , or look at it ; and just hide it away from them .
In the end , the problem will be solved .
