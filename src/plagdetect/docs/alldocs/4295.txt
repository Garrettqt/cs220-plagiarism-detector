Do you ever feel like books , music , movie , magazines and etc.
, are offensive sometimes ?
To my experience of lising to music and watching movies it can be offensive somtimes with out even knowing it .
I have lisn to rap before and all the cuss words they use , and watching movies with only white people or black people .
So I think some music , moives and etc.
, could be taking off .
If I think somthing is a offensive I pretty much blow it off like its nothing .
I do that beacuse I have watch @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 the white and black people didnt get a long , and they had to play football to geather .
Then they finally got along and won the champion game .
To me I think thats awesome beacause people were offensive , and got over it and now there friends .
So dont take @CAPS3 offensive .
I say that beacuse how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you .
I look at this like its a little deal .
I like @CAPS3 like that I find it entertanment .
It can also help you learn , about whats happening to our world , and what we have acomplished .
So I really dont take this @CAPS3 a offensive .
But , other people can take it offensive and thats there problem .
There is nothing that can be done its over with .
If something is a offensive then dont lisn to it or dont watch or read it .
So dont think its right to pull it of the shelf and abhor it .
They can have a really good meaning behind it .
There are many movies , songs and books in the world that are good .
So dont abominate it and go on in life dont let @CAPS3 get to you .
Thats why I dont think its right to pull it off the shelf and take it offenisive .
Thats why I think it not bad to take @CAPS3 offensive .
