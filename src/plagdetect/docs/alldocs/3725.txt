Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books .
Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway .
@CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it .
So school went by the bell rang it was time to go .
When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian .
On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink .
While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf .
when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help .
@CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her .
That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs .
And moving the to the back closet .
About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones .
Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way .
