No books should be taken off the shelf .
Most people have different taste in books , magazines or movies .
If people find one of those offensive , then why can't they ignore it ?
They can go find a different one .
Not everyone should have the same taste as one person , thats what makes the person we are today .
If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world.I 'm more into horror novels more than anything .
My own opinion , I think they have alot of excitement ; with the killing and what not .
I 'm also not a big fan of reading , I read when I absolutely have nothing to do.Its very hard to move onto a different series of novels .
Such as : romance , horror , adventures , even poetry !
It takes alot to understand poetry .
Poetry has alot of big descriptive words .
@PERSON1 for instance , he's one of my favorite poets ; he's actually pretty famous for what all he has done .
Well , he didn't become famous until after his death.Overall , not everyone has the same taste in books , magazines , movies or even poetry .
We 're all different even when it comes to this .
