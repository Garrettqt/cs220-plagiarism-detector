Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 , I believe that the country should take off all the books , movies , magazines , and music that has any kind of offensive cover , or any offensive mind grabbing , sexal contact in any of the story , music , etc .
Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around , the radio for example , the music that they put on like rap , hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony , cars , girls , and sex .
Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio , and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts , not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines , and movies .
So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands .
