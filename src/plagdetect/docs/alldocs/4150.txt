When walking into the library and children are finding books , movies and magazines they should not look at .
It can be offensive .
I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work .
I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at .
My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book .
I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not .
Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read .
I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person .
I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book , movie , or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible .
I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book .
If it offends them then they should not read the book , and choose another book .
Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process .
My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone .
My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday .
But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries
