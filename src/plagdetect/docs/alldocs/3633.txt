In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes .
But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter ?
Thats the question .
Some might find it offensive and others @MONTH1 not .
It all depends on the person .
Libraries cant please everyone .
In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves , because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys .
Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs .
Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials ' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials.Then 'people who find it offensive ' and 'people who dont ' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem .
If this solution doesn't work there are many more .
The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all .
Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials .
Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one .
