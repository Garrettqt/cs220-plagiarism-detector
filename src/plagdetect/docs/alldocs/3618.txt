Should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs ?
I think it should be .
There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs .
I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books .
So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all .
I beleve any book , movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age .
If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books .
Removing teh books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion .
I would not want my @NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it .
Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing .
There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children .
They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals .
I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing .
They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good .
If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not .
I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things .
I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life .
We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids .
If we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things .
So lets get the fi , ltering satrted and save the world and our kids future .
