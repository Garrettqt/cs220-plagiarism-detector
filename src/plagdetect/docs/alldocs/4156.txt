I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries .
They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it .
People have different beliefs about anything , I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything .
So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine , but don't ruin it for others , you ever heard the saying , `` if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all '' , well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read .
Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1 , the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history , the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library .
That is history in this world and they should know it .
That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world , history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world , this compares with the topic fully .
I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about .
That will be all
