Many people like different books , music , movies , and magazines .
Some people take offense to them .
Others do not .
For me I dont .
I do not believe that certain materials such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc , should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people .
If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back .
If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I 'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book .
There are o lot of people in the world after all .
For music there's different types also .
There's rap , country , rock , pop and many more .
For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country .
If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others @MONTH1 like country and want to listen to it .
For movies there are many different types .
There's horror , comedy , romance and many more .
That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies .
People always have a choice .
Many people like different books , music , movies , and magazines .
Some people take offense to them although some don't .
Every person is different .
People like different things .
That is , in my opinion , the beauty of human nature
