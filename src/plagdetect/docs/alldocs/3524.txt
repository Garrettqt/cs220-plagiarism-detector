Who is to label a book offensive ?
What one might find appauling , others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting .
All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people .
Libraries banning books , music , movies , or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests .
Books such as The @CAPS1 , The @CAPS2's @CAPS3 , and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves .
Though people @MONTH1 check these books out , many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books .
I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings , and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot .
If books are banned from libraries , it almost seems as if they 're limiting our education .
Why would a book be published , or written for that matter , if we were not intended to read it ?
Any book could be offensive to any one person .
Any article , song , or film could be offensive .
But , there will always be a crowd it appeals to .
And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word .
Censorship in libraries has gone on too long , it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them .
The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories .
First by subject , down to the author .
Therefore , books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such , but are still available to those who want to read them .
Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day .
People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it .
All books are written to be read , and with the division of such books , everyone can agree upon this : books help us grow .
Growth is not meant to be limited , nor is freedom .
