Do you think that books , music , movies , magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored ?
Why should information and knowledge be with held from people ?
Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading , but also the human race .
There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries .
I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries .
In the @ORGANIZATION1 , everyone is given the right of free speech .
Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox ' or 'offensive ' takes away that persons ' rights .
Also , people go to libraries to find something out .
They look for knowledge and taking away a persons ' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone .
When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive ' and 'unorthodox . '
We will take away man kind's capacity to learn .
Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as : inappropriate language in songs , books , movies , and magazines .
Also , obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines .
These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version .
All minor adjustments and easy to make .
Taking media off the shelves is not needed .
The material is not serious enough .
Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read , listen , or watch .
A library is made forwhat the people want to learn .
Taking that away is very serious .
