In @LOCATION1 , people like to do many dfferent things for fun .
Some like to go to movies .
Others perfer a nice walk through the park .
Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad , nasty , offensive things .
I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want .
The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to .
There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things .
We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not .
Its not fair to those who want to read it .
I find it very dumb .
The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it , dont read it .
This is a very simple an straight forward concept .
Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing .
If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it .
If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me , i wouldnt read it .
Its just that easy .
The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read .
Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny .
If we all just worried about our selfs , then we would be better off .
If i read a book that i found offensive or bad , i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs .
Its not right and its not fair .
We should be able to read what ever we want .
Its our right to read it .
Also , if you dont like it , then dont read it .
People today are too worried about other people .
If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad , there is nothing that you can do about it .
That is the way life works .
