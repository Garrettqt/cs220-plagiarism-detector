Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
No , I do not believe they should be , but that is my opinion .
It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school , so why should we remove it ?
Music , movies , magazines , and books all have material such as ; racism , murders , innopropriate language , etc .
When we find materials , like those listed before offensive outside of school , we stay away from them .
We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive .
Movies and books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we right essays over those topics .
It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there .
One hundred percent of factual books is correct .
You will have no worries then .
Therefore , I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed .
It is a pointless task to do .
Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also .
