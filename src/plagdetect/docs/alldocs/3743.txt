Dear Newspaper , I don't think there should be censorship at all .
Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy .
Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist .
Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone ?
It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie .
There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries .
My first reason is freedom of speech .
People have the right to say or write whatever they believe .
Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend .
Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to .
Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way .
By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves .
Not having these books up on the shelves , means no one can read them .
If no one can read the books , no one learns .
One more thing to take into consideration , is the authors money .
Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like , I 'll go buy it .
But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them .
The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money .
If we take the books down , they dont make money and they dont make their intended point .
In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea .
One because of freedom of speech .
Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature .
Third is its taking away authors money and point of view .
These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory .
