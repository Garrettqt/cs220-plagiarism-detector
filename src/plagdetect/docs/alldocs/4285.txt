Do people take offensive books serious .
There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive .
Some other people @MONTH1 think differently .
I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves , but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways .
I feel that certain materials that young people see in books , music , and movies are at the library .
They see stuff that's around them .
they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too .
The author of the quote ( Katherine Paterson ) can't just blame it all on the library .
In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing .
Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get .
Kids like to play with stuff they first see .
If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs .
I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive .
I just don't pay any attention to it anyway .
We are living in a better world that it was years ago .
If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that , then what are they still here for .
When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library .
We shoudn't take books offensive .
After all they are just words on a piece of paper .
I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library .
Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly .
