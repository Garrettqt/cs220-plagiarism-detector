Do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read , listen to or view what we want ?
I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want .
I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene .
I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it .
That is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship .
