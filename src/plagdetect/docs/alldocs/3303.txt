I 'm writing this paper today to talk about cenorship of books , movies , music , etc .
I think that there should only be certain things on the self that childern can see .
If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to .
They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1 .
I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see .
Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children .
I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else .
Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are .
There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio , on @CAPS2 , in books .
They are everywhere .
Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff .
It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not .
We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1 .
There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff .
That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that .
I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less
