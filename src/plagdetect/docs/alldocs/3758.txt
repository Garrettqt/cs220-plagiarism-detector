The question is , should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive ?
In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material .
Some things that we read , see , and hear are just going to be offensive , and we cant control everything that offends us .
I do agree that people have freedom of speech , but not over everything .
People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @DATE1 .
Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there .
For example , some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset over slavery , and that happened over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1 .
Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass .
We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places .
Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future .
Why ?
Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries .
Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons ?
My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone .
I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it .
Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes .
