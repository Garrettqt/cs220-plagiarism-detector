People should not take all the books out for the librarie .
Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also .
If people start taking books out , all the book will be gone .So that would mean where would be no books form people to look at .
So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time .
That would help to kept all the books in the liberary .
So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out .
So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time .
And how long you can have the books for .
If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged .
The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in .
Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount .
So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books .
About the Book , moives , and magzines that are the liberary .
All the books , moives and magzines should stay on the shelves .
Because if you take out one you should take out all off them .
Beacuse every one needs to see these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a movie or a magzine it should stay on the shelves .
So if a book , magzine , or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did .
If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read .
So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book , moive and magzine .
