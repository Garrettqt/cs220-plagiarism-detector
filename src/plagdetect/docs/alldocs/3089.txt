We 've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words , and we 've all seen @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way .
Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics .
Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it , while others think that it is no big deal because , eventually , people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway .
If you were an author , musician , or director , wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it ?
Most of those people would , and get angry when their work is edited .
They want their work to be heard , and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words .
This can also cause the original message to be completely missed , and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean .
However , another question arises : If you were a parent , would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies , or hear harsh words in music ?
Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand .
Eventually , though , kids are going to be faced with those things .
In conclusion , cenorship should just be ignored .
Children are going to end up hearing bad words , seeing inappropriate things , and reading offensive passages in books or magazines .
Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians .
There are loads of harsh things in the world , its impossible to just edit them all out
