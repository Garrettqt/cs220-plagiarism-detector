Censorship in libraries !
Do you believe that certianmaterials , such as books , music , movies , magazines , etc.
, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive ?
NO !
, I do not think they should be removed .
I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion , @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another .
No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books , music , movies etc .
If you take out the 'offensive ' things , @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests
