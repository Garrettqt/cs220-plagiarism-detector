There are different types of books , movies , magnazines , and tape recorders in libraries .
Books can be fiction or nonfiction .
However , books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read .
So therefore , libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf .
Who picks out the books , movies , magnazines , and tape recorders ?
The answer is the customers at the library .
The authors of the books or items did not .
The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items .
No one can blame the authors .
Also , there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists .
Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear .
People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction .
My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others .
For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event .
People need to know what happened in the past with historical events .
People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not .
Therefore , people should not try to remove it .
If a child checks out a book and their parents let them , it is the parents fault .
It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out .
Also , if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf .
Like I said before , one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it .
Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources , and not to remove books or other source off the shelves .
