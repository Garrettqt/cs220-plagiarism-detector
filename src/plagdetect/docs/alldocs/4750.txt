There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards .
People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books .
Would you really want to take that from the people ?
If my arguement did ' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter .
