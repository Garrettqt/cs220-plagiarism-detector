I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library .
If you think a book would be offensive to you , dont read it .
If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion , just keep your opinion to yourself .
Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention .
If a library was split up into sections about topics and such , it would help a lot , and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others .
I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library , but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it .
And if there isnt one , its probly because someone complained about it .
If you are religious , you should have the right to be able to read what you want .
Theres all kinds of weird books in the library , and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it .
I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things .
Like I said before , if you dont like it , dont read it
