To begin with , a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense .
But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it .
Should it be taken off the shelf ?
No why should it .
Different people have different perpectives on what they 're reading .
Not all people feel the same way .
Samething goes for music , movies , magazines , etc .
They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it .
It was there choice to pick it up and read it .
No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc . '
@CAPS1 , why should a book , etc.
, be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it ?
You still have the rest of the population who might love it , some might just like it , and the ones who don't .
You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle .
If that person finds that book , etc.
, offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did .
It's there own fault .
For my conclusion , nothing should be taken off the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc .
Another person might read it and like it .
Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way .
Keep the book etc.
, on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive .
Then what we will be able to read or listen too
