Censorship in public libraries , allowed ?
I believe it should be , with a few different veiw points .
For one , why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series ?
Two , @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways .
Also @CAPS2 , reading is one of those things that we differ with each other .
One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories , than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read .
With all of us being different all over the world .
Humans have different taste in food , music , movies , and books .
All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings , to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that , and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment , so why would you take away books that people love to read freely ?
To me , in my eyes is just not right .
It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out .
What I mean by that is , that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on , but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out , than why take the candy away ?
Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about , which they do .
People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot .
Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this ?
We are all the same , yet in books we find each other inside of them , finding ourselves into books , I know many book readers with different types of tastes .
No matter who they were and who their friends were , we all are different .
To many people other than myself , would agree with that .
So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries
