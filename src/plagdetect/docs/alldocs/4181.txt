Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's , music , movie's , magazines , etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way .
Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people .
Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books .
There should be no sexual or racial book's , movies , magazines , etc .
Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out .
I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's , and movies , etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like .
But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's .
If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them .
It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf .
So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries .
Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy .
