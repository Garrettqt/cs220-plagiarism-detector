libraries have tons ... of books , cd's , movies , and magazines for people to read .
they have all kinds for people who have intrest in certain things.and some might be offensive to some people ... let me tell you what i think !
Most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things .
There are certaint things for people for certaint ages to look at , there kids sections there is a teen section and there is an adult section .
there could be some stuff that people will think is offensive .
but that doesnt mean they would have to take @CAPS4 off the shelf they @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have to grab @CAPS4 .
simple as that .
and thats all there is to @CAPS4 .. and thats what i think about library products like that .
and what people should do to not getting stuff that is offensive to them ... ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ' !
