Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way .
I have even read excellent books that offend me .
If we didn't have books and stories that offend us , then we would never really find out what offends us .
That is why I don't think books , magazines , music , or anything of that nature that @MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves .
If you think about , almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings .
It just depends on how you feel about what has been written .
Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people @MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people .
If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them , then there would be no books left .
Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel , or tell a story about yourself or someone else .
Some authors @MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner .
Others @MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea .
Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive .
In conclusion , i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because , if we took all of them off , there would not be a very wide selection of books left
