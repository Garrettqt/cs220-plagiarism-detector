Censorship , or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive , has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries .
The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown .
The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda , but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance .
Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today , as a way to 'protect the children ' .
The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and can not watch on television and what we can and can not listen to on the radio .
Other organizations tell us what books we can and can not read , what video games we can and can not play , and what items we can and can not buy .
Such organizations , I believe , are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism .
As Katherine Paterson stated , 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else . '
If one person has the right to control what we buy , what we listen to , and what we see , then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them ?
Where do we draw the line ?
Eventually , all books , movies , magazines , music , and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate .
Culture would slowly wither and die , and our lives would become drab and essentially useless , for lack of a better term .
I recently read a book titled ' @CAPS14 ' , by @PERSON2 , about two periods in a boy's life : his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2 , and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3 .
@PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic , and , had strict censorship been in place , these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished .
@PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7 , and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family , friends , and comfort .
All in all , censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives .
If you get to censor something you find offensive , then why don't I do the same thing ?
Some censorship is good , and a fact of life .
But we have to ask ourselves , where do we draw the line ?
Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state ?
Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17 , as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens .
As a famous colonial revolutionary once said , ' @CAPS19 me liberty , or @CAPS19 me death ! '
If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier , then I shall take death over liberty , for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all .
