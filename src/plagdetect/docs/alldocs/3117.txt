Going into a @CAPS1 everyone has there own opinons as to what they should see on the shelfs , and what should be put out on the shelfs for everyone to see including children of all ages .
Some people @MONTH1 agree that there should only be thnigs that is age appropiate for everyone , others disagree .
In my opinion when im looking at this topic , i think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group , but there should also be a kid section .
If parents are so concernced about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those .
There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out .
When it comes to looking at magazines , movies , and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect .
There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelfs , because its not like people can listen to it by looking at the @CAPS2 .
But my opinion on the magazines , and movies could vary .
There is a certain extant for movies , and magazines .
I think they should all be aloud on the shelfs , minus any pornography .
The reason i think like this is because , kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelfs at a library .
Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them .
But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library .
There is some where to draw the line , in any situation and thats where i think it should be drawn at a library .
