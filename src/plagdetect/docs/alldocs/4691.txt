What race are you ?
What religion are you ?
What have you been taught ?
Almost anything like these could be considered offensive .
So should these types of things be taken out of libraries ?
No , these types of things are everywhere .
You just can't get away from them .
Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials .
For example the commercials for @CAPS1 gum with that @CAPS2 woman , some people might consider that offensive .
You might ask , ' @CAPS3 ' , well there might be a person who has a diesease who can't get that 'clean feeling ' and always has bad breath .
That person might take offense to these commercials .
Another example might be television shows , like @ORGANIZATION1 .
Some @CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things .
Does that really mean we should get rid of them though ?
People everywhere are somehow offended by something , the world isn't perfect .
Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries , it could still be seen .
So whats the point ?
If you tried to take it all out , like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy .
There is no such thing as a perfect world , I believe if there was people would go crazy .
For example in the movie ' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 , ' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The @CAPS7 @CAPS8 ' or a perfect society .
In the town at first everything is nice , but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves .
The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else .
Also they help kids learn , if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything , then how far are they going to get in life ?
So should these things go away or not ?
What do you think ?
