The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group .
Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity .
they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive .
Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge .
They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling .
They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this .
If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in .
With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them .
We can not controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries
