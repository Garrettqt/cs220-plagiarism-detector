Censorship in Libraries I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed .
Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive .
Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows .
I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view .
If something was removed every time someone would walk in , then there would be no library .
A library is supposed to be a variety of books .
It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes .
It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety , then the library would lose all kinds of customers .
A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts .
The library wants to target all aspects of people .
Even if it means that some content is innapropriate .
All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way .

Not just one genre a person wants .
