Newpaper company , @CAPS1 am writing to this company on why I think the certain books , music , movies and magazine should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive .
@CAPS1 wirting to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince a argument .
@CAPS1 reflecting my view on censorship in libraries .
@CAPS1 writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and persuasive you on this essay .
First , I think know book should be taking off on any shelf of any library .
Rather if it was to do with people thoughts on religious , race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past .
For example , gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic .
I beileve that know one should disrespect anyone opinion on what they have to say .
It depends on what kind of language your using for this type of subject if its has harsh words and its suppose to be harmful , then yes it should be remove .
Another thing is children taken books off shelves .
Maybe you should ascort your child in the child section and telling him or her what they should not do like taking stuff down that they are not suppose to .
What I 'm saying is if suppose to hurt other and is offensive using negatively words to harm others feelings , it should be remove .
My letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not .
I have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation .
I hope my topics and argurment has convince you on if you should remove a book from a shelf .
