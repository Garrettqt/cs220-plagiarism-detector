To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 , my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2 .
I do agree that books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from the shelves .
If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves .
Many of the books that children , teens , and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world .
Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others .
It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool .
If we could put more important learning books , movies , and ect .. there would be less aggression in the world .
Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear .
Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing .
Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling .
Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to .
You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into .
That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life .
It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can
