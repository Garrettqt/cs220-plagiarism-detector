Censorship at the library is not needed at all times .
It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids .
It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do .
There are certin cases when it's needed though .
It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do .
They are the ones in charge of the kids .
they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong .
They are the ones who are raising the kids , not the library .
Other wise , they parents are having their job done for them .
The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them .
I do get it if they pull off books , movies , and magizines for adults , but if there is one little word in there , people will just have to get over it .
Isn't that why people are wanting classic books , such as ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 ' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1 , ' changed ?
Because black people find it offensive ?
It's not rignt .
People are trying to rewrite history ; to sugar-coat the truth .
Well , the books are like the real world .
People aren't always going to be nice to you .
They can be down right mean some times .
The whole world is just corupted .
There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature .
People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books , the language limited to one or two bad words .
They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive .
The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read .
The library shouldn't censor their books .
