Censorship in Libraries Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say , ' @CAPS1 !
That's inappropriate ! '
If so , I am sure your not alone .
Just the other day I was in the library .
There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental .
I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive .
How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this ?
How does this affect the minds of our country's youth ?
My thought on this topic is clear , although I am sure I 'd recieve some opposition from others , considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter .
I do realize the library has age limits on rentals , but what about all these posters everywhere ?
You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it .
I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material .
Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @CAPS2 .
New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library .
Even the covers of some @CAPS2 should be removed for the good of the public .
It's interesting how these things just slide by the library .
I once saw a young by renting a @CAPS4 that had the words 'parental advisory ' right on the cover !
No one stopped him .
Books are the same way .
Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library .
No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves .
So , when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries ?
It is hard to say , but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this .
I hope you 'll join me in this epic battle for censorship , to keep our youth safe
