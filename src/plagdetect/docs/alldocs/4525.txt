Libraries have books that are short , long , and everything in between .
Their are good and bad books , but that all depends on the opinion of the reader .
There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf .
The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book .
Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you ?
No , you wouldn't get it again .
So why 'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more .
Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else .
In conclusion , the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it .
Pushy people aren't normally liked by others .
Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader .
That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf .
