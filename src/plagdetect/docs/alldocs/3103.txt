I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel , and do what ever they want .
We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in , but thats not true .
We need to set boundries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do .
We need to show them that we know what they doing .
I think that there should be an age policy for libraries .
If there are any books that have any types of adult content , they should be in the adult section .
If you ever wanted to check out books , movies , or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older .
If that was to much to ask for then you should at least have the parents sign a concent form .
Book , movies , and magiznes with any type of adult content can be harzardess to child , whether its through their actions or behaviors .
It @MONTH1 effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things .
We need to show them that we care .
I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this , drasticly changes people , not over time but quickly .
Now a days the media is portarying that money , alcohal , fame , and drugs are good things .
This is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines , and putting into the children of @CAPS1 heads .
We are telling them that its ok , but its most certanly not .
These are all the reasons why we should put cencorships and restrictions on libraries .
We are letting the children of @CAPS2 grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early .
In a way we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive live , through adult oriented things
