There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes .
Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves .
Such as movies , books , magazines , etc.
, they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions .
Censorship can be used to solve this problem , like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 , it was used to keep books out of the picture completely .
To keep the society from becoming offended , or for that matter , thinking .
However in this matter it is the complete opposite , having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people , or @MONTH1 damage other people .
However this can also be argued .
The people that are offended by the material , wether religious or race , really don't have to be around the material in the first place .
For example if the material is in a library , then the people don't need to go to the library .
In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended , but people should not be so cruel also .
