Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you ?
What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian ?
Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears ?
Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you .
I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive .
That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you , it's just flat out wrong I would say .
So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies .
Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not .
So to wrap this all up nice and sweet .
Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also .
That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read .
If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
