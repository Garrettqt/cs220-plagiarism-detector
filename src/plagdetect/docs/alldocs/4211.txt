There are many different things in the media that is shown everyday that is very offensive .
Im sure everyone can honestly say that they 've watched or heard atleast one thing in the media that they got offended by .
Also people need to remember that this is a free country , and everyone has freedom of speech .
None of the television company's , or radio stations should get in trouble , because it's freedom of speech .
I don't get offended by anything I read , listen to , anything on t.v .
I really don't see how people can get offended by any of it , because it's not like anything is being directly said to that person who's offended .
I have heard of people trying to sue record company's for songs that they found offensive .
I think that is rediculous to try to sue someone just because you got offended by it .
It's not the record company's fault if you took offense to it , and there is no reason why a fan should have to suffer because of a reason like that .
