Yes I believe certain material should be removed from the shleves at a library if they are offensive !
because people dont want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone , let them come in and @CAPS1 some book or etc offensive to that person .
Like a child grabbed some bad unapropriate book and his mommy found him reading it so she wasnt to happy and left .
t @CAPS1 that could be offensive to anyone particular .
Their are certain books , magaizines , etc that dont need to be in the library .
Becasue the public doesnt need to @CAPS1 stuff like that in a public library .
By the way someone that could think that certain book in offensive could report that certain book or etc if it is offensive to someone that is irregular at that certain public library .
So watch what you bring or put in a public library it has to apropriate to where all the publics that walk in to any nice library .
Being offensive , is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk in a nice public library and be relaxed not startled by any none reasonable book or magazines or etc that should be there .
Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because theres so many unaproperiate , bad language music around here that they have to watch what they put in the library ecspecially for the little kids , seniors too .
Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people , not for people to look at or find on he shelves a offensive book or magazine because thats not what the library is for , its for going there relaxing and finding a book or etc to have and be good with , or checked out to use somewhere else
