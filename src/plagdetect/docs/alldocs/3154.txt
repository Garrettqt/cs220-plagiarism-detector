Dear @ORGANIZATION1 , I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them .
Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves , if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun .
It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials .
Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing .
If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention ?
In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf .
These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention .
Keep these items on the shelves !
