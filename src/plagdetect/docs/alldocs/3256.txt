I myself beleves that censorship in libraries should not be aloud .
If their was to be any cersorship it should be from the parents of a child or if your not a child then you dont need censored .
By censoring something as small as books , movies , and so on I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens .
Just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather .
Think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor people will say bad words , show bad habits , and even go as far as seeing death or more .
Being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books ive learned alot but I feel as if I went to a librarie to get a book and if censored or taken off the shelf then I will shown a fake world .
Once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt consor anything else .
A censored book , movie or whatever it @MONTH1 be could also determin how much someone could learn from it .
People go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up .
This is some of meny reasons I think cendor in libraries shouldnt be aloud .
Consorship should be chosen by who you are not by outher people .
In the end we @MONTH1 never know whats better till we try .
