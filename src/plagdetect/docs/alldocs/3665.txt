Removal of Books If there is a book that someone takes offensive , should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves ?
No , even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive , they should not remove the books off shelves .
When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on ' A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ' .
I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help , the privilage to read the book has been taking away .
The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools , due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive .
After many reports about the book , the book was taken out of the library .
For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book .
If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book , they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them .
Many people love different types of books , no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them .
I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want , books are made to be read and looked at .
If books are being taking away then very less books will be read .
But the more books read and understood , more books will be wrote and published .
The same has to do with music , movies , magazines , ect , they all are made for a reason and should be checked out .
@CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading , listening , reveiwing , ect , even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive , they @MONTH1 teach lessons .
