Most people have been debating on whether or not to stop giving out books , movies , music , magazines , and so on , if they are disturbing other peoples lives , and offending them to the point where they are getting infuriated , and disturbing the peace .
I also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books , music , and so on .
But I would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear .
I think that this accomnomy should get over itself and learn to live their lives .
I personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves , stores , like music for instance .
I do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff , if they are happy then so be it then they are happy .
I do not think that people who actually enjoy reading , and hearing what is disturbing that Other people should be punished just because somebody else does not like what they are hearing or reading .
Why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not hurting anything or anybody .
I personally , in my own opinion think that would not be fair .
because , in my experience I do not think people should complain .
What is in these stores only makes us stronger .
