The library has many books , they would have anything that you could possibly imagine.The library is a great resource for any information .
They have so much information that if you were to go to the library , you would be there all day .
Libraries carry many different kinds of books .
They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats .
There are libraries all around us and are very convienent .
If a library carried misleading books , music , movies , or even magazines , I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble , especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information , would show anything that would affend someone in any way , then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf .
When people go to the library they are exspecting clean reviews about the library .
If a library were ment to carry offensive products it would not be called the library .
The library is ment to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe , or just go in and get what they need and come right on out .
Most libraries are pretty peticular of what they should or should not put out on there shelves .
If someone put something way out of the ordinary , and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired .
In conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city .
The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books , music , and etc .
You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf , and if you happen to find one you should imediently tell the librarian or the libraries manager .
