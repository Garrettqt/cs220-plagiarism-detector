My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways .
Certain materials , such as books , music , movies , and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person .
If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed .
People might change their mind about going to that particular library , if they find a lot of offensive things there .
Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds , and it could possibly change how most children act , or think .
A few things that I would find , that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs , nudity , horrible violence , and bullying .
From my own experience , having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live , if you take them seriously .
Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books , magazines , or videos .
I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it , even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it .
In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them .
I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things , from all libraries .
Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean , nasty , and offensive materials
