I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves .
I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not .
I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me .
Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them .
Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in .
The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent .
This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there .
But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion .
That just because they wrote that article , doesn't make it true .
This arguement went out of hand .
She had her opinion and I also had mine .
My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework .
While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd .
I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was .
My friend went to my sterio and turned it off .
She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music .
So after that we pretty much argued the whole time .
I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it .
We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it , I felt I would respect her feelings .
Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart .
When an author writes a story or an article , they are putting their opinion into it .
Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say .
I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it , dont pick it up and read it .
