Dear @CAPS1 : Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library ?
Would you want your children influenced by these findings ?
These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries .
As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries .
In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines , books , and music that are offensive .
I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries .
There are many people that still would want these materials , so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials .
If there was a seperate room , we can keep these materials away from young kids .
When I get older and have children , I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place .
In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all .
Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go : a college kid trying to prepare for a test , a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1 , or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet .
The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library .
Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside .
For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true .
If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see , they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there .
Libraries need to be kid friendly places , so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer .
As you can see , offensive materials should not be in libraries .
All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer , and with some materials that is not possible .
Please consider the following .
Kind regards , @PERSON2
