Most people consider libraries an unharmful place .
However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves .
Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover .
I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well .
Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries .
A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way ; by reading books !
Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image ?
Nudity , cursing , and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library .
It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine .
What kind of message are we trying to send to them ?
That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus ?
I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries .
Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines , I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries .
Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well .
We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1 .
Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon .
I 'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past .
No matter where you are you can not escape offensive gestures ; but please let's keep it out of the library .
