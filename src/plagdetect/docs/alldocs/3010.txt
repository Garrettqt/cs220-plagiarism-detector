Many people believe that magazines , books , movies , music , posters , plus some other kind of bad stuff that parents don't want there @CAPS1 to see .
Some of the stuff they might have in the are books about different colored people , maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin hairitage , @CAPS1 that are to young to be looking at stuff that is in these books .
A lot of the @CAPS2 Libraries have these things speard around all over the store .
Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color .
If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book .
Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story , music , movie , poster .
But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it .
Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book
