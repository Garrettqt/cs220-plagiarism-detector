Dear @PERSON1 news paper editor .
Pulling a book , cd , dvd/vcr tape , magazine , etc.
, because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting , and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth .
If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading .
I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone , and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions .
If they are offended they can go to read some where else .
I understand that people might have been there first .
If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else .
The world is not a perfect place by no means .
The world does have it's positives for instance the @CAPS1 nations , and north atlantic treaty organization ( @CAPS2.A.T.O .
)
, but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them .
That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenties in all the books so that way boredom and perfection could slowly but surely set into the worlds minds to be okay .
Well I refuse to let it set into my mind , and I hope you choose the same for yourself .
Your's @CAPS3 @CAPS4
