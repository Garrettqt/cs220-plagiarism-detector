I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who dont like , or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf .
Someone shouldn't have a problem with goin or taking their children to the library .
A public library is visited by children of all age's , size's , and races .
If i took my child or children to a public library i dont want to worry about wether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or dont like
