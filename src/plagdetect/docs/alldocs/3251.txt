If everyone in the world could permantly take a book , movie , music , etc.
, off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy ?
I personally think that if people could do that they would , but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you ?
No , it might not be , so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it ?
I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it .
If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people ?
I dont think there would be .
Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same .
Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it .
On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf .
Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then ?
You can just take that person out of the world .
So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that .
To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you @MONTH1 not bee the same for others .
